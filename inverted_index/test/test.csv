"14444976","HMS Quail (G45)","{|Ship notesBadge: On a Field per fess Blue and Green, a quail White.|}HMS Quail was a Q class destroyer of the Navy.  She served during the World War but her career lasted less than a year before she was damaged by a mine and withdrawn from active service.Construction and commissioningQuail was ordered on 2 April 1940 to serve with the 3rd Emergency Flotilla.  She was laid down on 30 September 1940 from the yards of Leslie & Company, Hebburn and launched on 1 June 1942.  She was commissioned on 7 January 1943 having cost a total of 436,576, excluding equipment supplied by the Admiralty such as armaments, wireless and radar equipment.  She was adopted by the civil community of Islington. London in March 1942 following a successful Week for Savings.(Quails career)CareerConvoy escortAfter spending December 1942 undergoing contractors trials, Quail was commissioned on 7 January 1943.  She then took passage to join the Fleet at Flow, where she carried out working up exercises.  In February she was nominated to escort the joint military convoys WS27 and KMF10A during their passage from the Clyde.  WS27 was bound for the East via the of Good Hope, whilst KMF10A was headed for the Mediterranean via Gibraltar.  Having completed the escort duties, the naval command intended that Quail would join the 3rd Flotilla in the Ocean.(  She joined Convoy WS27 in the Clyde on 27 February, along with the battleship HMS Malaya and the destroyers HMS Raider, Quadrant, Queenborough and Wolverine as the ocean escort for the convoys passage through the Atlantic. Quail remained with Convoy WS27 when the ships of KMF10A were detached on 2 March to sail to Gibraltar.  On 5 March HMS Quadrant was detached and on 8 March Quail, Queenborough and Raider were detached from the convoy on its arrival at Freetown, Sierra Leone.  They were then retained at Freetown for convoy defence, whilst the planned transfer to the Indian Ocean was cancelled to due to future requirements in support of the planned allied landings in Mediterranean.(Fleet screeningOn 11 March Quail was deployed with Queenborough and Raider to cover the passage of convoy WS27, bound for Durban.  They escorted it to Durban, arriving on 24 March when they were detached.  They returned to Freetown in April, where Quail was nominated to return to the UK.  She took passage from Freetown on 29 April in company with HMS Quality.  They arrived in the UK, and rejoined the flotilla at Scapa Flow in May.  In June Quail was nominated to support the allied landings in Sicily (Operation Husky).(  She sailed for Gibraltar as part of an escort for capital ships of the Home Fleet that were also assigned to cover the landings.  She deployed out of Malta and on 8 July sailed as part of a screen for the battleships HMS Nelson, Rodney, Warspite and Valiant, the carriers HMS Indomitable and Formidable and the cruisers HMS Aurora, Penelope, Cleopatra and Euryalus, with the destroyers HMS Quilliam, Queenborough, Isis, Faulknor, Echo, Intrepid, Raider, Eclipse, Fury, Inglefield, Ilex, Troubridge, Tyrian, Tumult, Offa, the Greek Vasilissa Olga and the Polish ORP Piorun in the Western Mediterranean.(  They provided cover against Italian interference in the allied landings, and by 12 July the escorting destroyers were deployed on interception patrols.  On 14 July Quail and Quilliam deployed with the cruisers Cleopatra and Euryalus off the east coast of Sicily.(BombardmentsQuail continued on these duties throughout August and on 21 August she carried out a bombardment of the Italian mainland from the of Messina.(  Ten days later on 31 August she was part of a screen for the battleships Nelson and Rodney and the cruiser HMS Orion during the preliminary bombardment of the Italian coast between Calabria and Pessaro before the allied landings in Italy.  Quail carried out bombardments and screening duties with the destroyers HMS Offa, Petard, Queenborough, Quilliam, Tartar, Troubridge, Tyrian and ORP Piorun in early September.  On 2 September Quail bombarded the area south of Reggio and from 9 September to 16 September she joined other destroyers in screening the battleships Nelson, Rodney, Warspite and Valiant, and the aircraft carriers Illustrious and Formidable.  They provided gunfire support off the beach head and carried out anti submarine and E-boat patrols.(  In October Quail was transferred to the Adriatic and based at Bari to support military operations and escort convoys. On 22 October she intercepted and captured an enemy merchant ship during a patrol.(Mining and sinkingOn 15 November, whilst on patrol in the Adriatic, Quail struck a mine that had been part of a barrage laid by U-453 on 25 October.(  She was beached the following day to await salvage.  In December she was towed to Bari to undergo temporary repairs.(  She spent the period between January and April 1944 under temporary repair to allow her to make passage to Taranto for permanent repairs.  She was towed to Taranto but whilst there it was arranged that she would be repaired at Malta.  After further preparations, she departed under tow for Malta in May, but capsized and sank en route in the of Taranto on 18 May.(On 5 June 2002 an Italian diver team led by Serpieri discovered the wreck of HMS Quail and filmed it. She currently lies at a depth of 90 metres.(Uboat.net)NotesReferences** External links*HMS Quails wartime career*HMS Quail at Uboat.net Quail (G45)"
"3479688","Colonial navies of Australia","thumb|250px|An artists impression of the ironclad HMVS Cerberus (left) and the training ship HMVS Nelson (right). The Victorian naval force was considered the most powerful of all the colonial naval forces.Before Federation in 1901 five of the six separate colonies maintained their own naval forces for defence. The colonial navies were supported by the ships of the Royal Navys Station which was established in 1859. The separate colonies maintained control over their respective navies until 1 March 1901, when the Naval Force was created.New South WalesNew South Wales Naval BrigadeNew South Wales Naval Artillery VolunteersAs Sydney was the major base for the Navy in Australia, the New South Wales Government had no incentive to create their own naval force. This sense of security ended with the outbreak of the War and in 1854 the government asked for tenders for the construction of a gunboat to assist in the defence of Sydney. The vessel was named Spitfire and was the first naval vessel completed by an Australian colonial government. Although modified from an existing boat(The Maitland & Hunter River General Advertiser, 11 August 1855), Spitfire was nevertheless the first warship to be constructed in Australia. Spitfire remained in service with the New South Wales colonial navy until 1859 when she was given to Queensland.thumb|left|The torpedo boat Avernus in Sydney HarbourAfter the construction of Spitfire (launched 4 April 1855) the New South Wales Government took no further steps in developing a naval force until a naval brigade of 120 men was formed in 1863. There was strong support for the naval brigade and in 1864 it consisted of five companies, four in Sydney and one in Newcastle, with an overall strength of 200 men. The naval brigade headquarters was established at Macquarie, where the Opera House today stands. Since Spitfire was sold to Queensland in 1859, the naval brigade had no ships of their own. This problem was not rectified until the late 1870s, when the government ordered the construction of two second class torpedo boats, Avernus and Acheron; these vessels were constructed in Sydney. In 1882, HMS Wolverine was acquired from the Royal Navy.HMS Wolverine was paid off in 1893 and the total number of vessels used by the Navy decreased over time as any perceived threat diminished. The naval brigade continued to grow, however, and reached a total strength of 614 men at Federation.Queenslandthumb|HMQS Paluma in 1889Queensland Maritime Defence ForceOne of the many outcomes of the reports was the formation of the Queensland Maritime Defence Force in 1883. Its purpose was to assist in the defence of Queenslands extensive coastline. To equip the new force the colonial government purchased two gunboats and a torpedo boat whilst port facilities and headquarters were established at Kangaroo Point, Brisbane. The gunboats Paluma and Gayundah were ordered from the shipyards of Mitchell and Company and featured a shallow draft capable of operating in the many bays and estuaries along the coast. Gayundah served as a training ship and conducted the first ship to shore radio transmissions in Australia whilst Paluma was lent to the Navy to carry out survey work on the Barrier Reef and along the Australian east coast. The torpedo boat Mosquito was ordered from Thornycroft of Chiswick. Mosquito was never commissioned but simply placed into service when required.From this beginning further vessels were acquired to give Queensland the second largest fleet in the colonies behind Victoria. Five government hopper barges were modified to act as Auxiliary Gunboats. These ships were built by Walkers in Maryborough and at 450 tons they appear to have been the largest warships built in the Australian colonies before federation. The ships had already been ordered for the Queensland Department of Harbours and Rivers when the decision was taken to convert them to also serve a military purpose. This resulted in the fitting of a 5-inch gun and the relocation of the boilers below the waterline. The torpedo launch Midge, mining tender Miner and patrol vessel Otter made up the rest of the Queensland vessels. The Queensland Government also established naval brigades in the major ports along the Queensland coast.The depression of the 1890s ruled out any further thoughts of expansion and greatly curtailed operations. Most of the vessels were placed in reserve only to be reactivated for annual training at Easter. Despite this, most went on to have long careers in both naval and private hands past War II. The wrecks of many can still be seen around Bay today.The Queensland Maritime Defence Force was not without controversy and difficulties. In October 1888, after a disagreement with the Queensland Government over conditions of service, Captain H.T. Wright R.N. commanding officer of Gayundah, was ordered to hand over to his second-in-command. Wrights response was to place his subordinate under arrest. He then coaled and provisioned the ship and threatened to sail her to Sydney. The Queensland Government ordered a police squad to relieve Captain Wright of his command. During the incident Captain Wright enquired from his gunner as to the best line of fire for his guns in order to hit Parliament House. The situation was eventually resolved. Of interest is the fact that, as Captain Wright had insisted, although Gayundah was the property of the Queensland government, it had, by Admiralty Warrant been accepted into Royal Navy service and thus as her captain he was only answerable to Rear-Admiral Fairfax the commander-in-chief of the Station.The Brisbane flood ripped Paluma from her moorings and left her well above the high water mark in the nearby City Botanical Gardens. Fortunately as locals considered how to return one of the colonys most powerful and most expensive assets to the River another major flood just two weeks later refloated the gunboat and she was pulled clear.Whilst these incidents may have been a source of mirth for those in the southern colonies it is important to note that Queensland officers went on to provide the backbone of the Naval Forces. In 1904, when a permanent Naval Board was established, it was Captain Creswell of Queensland and previously South Australia who was appointed as the Director of the Commonwealth Naval Forces and First Naval Member. At this time, 49% of the new forces officers had served with the Queensland Maritime Defence Force.The Queensland Marine Defence Force was the only Australian colonial navy not to be involved in a foreign conflict.South AustraliaSouth Australian Naval Servicethumb|left|Protector in 1900In the 1880s Australia began initial steps towards the establishment of a naval force. Sir William Jervois, then governor of Australia, was the strongest advocate for a colonial navy. September 1884 saw the arrival of the 920 tonne ship Protector, at the time the most advanced ship in any of the colonial navies.Protector was transferred to the Commonwealth in 1901, she also served in China during the Rebellion. The South Australian government also created a naval brigade to support the Protector. In 1905 the South Australian government negotiated the purchase of TB 191 from Tasmania, this ship was purchased as a torpedo boat and would allow the navy to use its torpedoes which had been purchased many years earlier.Tasmaniathumb|TB 191During the mid 1830s, the colony of Diemens Land constructed and operated the armed schooner Eliza. The vessel was built at Port Arthur and was operated by the Convict Marine Service, carrying out anti-piracy patrols as well as helping to maintain the security of the penal settlement. In 1883, Tasmania purchased the second-class torpedo boat TB 191.(Gillett (1977) refers to this vessel as TB 1 not TB 191.) The ship arrived in Hobart on 1 May 1884 and remained in Tasmania until it was transferred to Australia in 1905.VictoriaVictorian Naval ForcesThe Colony of Victoria commenced construction of its first armed vessel in 1853(U.S. Gazette 10 December 1853), HMCS Victoria which was launched on 30 June 1855 and arrived in Victoria on 31 May 1856. Victoria carried out a large variety of tasks during its life, including taking part in the Wars, assisting in the search for and Wills, delivering the first trout eggs to Tasmania, as well as numerous surveying and rescue tasks.In 1859 the first Naval Brigade was formed. The Brigade was re-organised in 1863 as a half-militia, re-formed in 1871 as the Victorian Naval Reserve as a full militia and re-formed again in 1885 as the Victorian Naval Brigade.The Victorian Naval Forces comprised the permanent force known as the Victorian Navy, and a 300-strong Victorian Naval Brigade consisting of the Williamstown Division and the Sandridge (Port Melbourne) Division. Combined the Victorian Navy and the Victorian Naval Brigade were known as the Victorian Naval Forces.Following the success of Victoria, the Victorian colonial government ordered an ironclad ship, HMVS Cerberus and was gifted the composite steam-sail warship, HMS Nelson.In 1884 several more warships were purchased by Victoria, these included the first-class torpedo boat Childers and second-class torpedo boats Lonsdale, and Nepean and the third-class gunboats Victoria and Albert. In 1886 the turnabout torpedo boat Gordon was acquired.  In 1892, the first-class torpedo boat, Countess of Hopetoun arrived in Victoria.To supplement the ships of the permanent force a number of government vessels were modified so as to serve as gunboats or torpedo boats. The hopper barges Batman and Fawkner were modified so as to mount a six-inch breech-loading gun at the bow of each ship. Two machine guns were also fitted. Strengthening of the bow, the fitting of a magazine, shell room, crew quarters and some armour protection for the crew added two more gunboats to the fleet. A compressor fitted to Fawkner meant that the torpedo boats could be serviced at sea. The tug boat Gannet and steamer Lady Loch were likewise modified.The Harbour Trust boats Commissioner and Customs No. 1 had two sets of torpedo dropping gear fitted to each boat thereby adding two more torpedo boats to the fleet. In 1885 the government steamers Lion and Spray were fitted with six-pounder Armstrong guns.  Spray was later fitted with two sets of torpedo dropping gear.Supporting the Victorian Naval Forces were the fortifications located at the entrance to Phillip Bay and other sites around the bay. In the years leading up to Federation the Victorian Naval Forces were considered the most powerful of all the colonial naval forces.Western AustraliaAustralia did not operate a colonial navy in the years before federation. Since Western Australia did not achieve self-government until 1890, the colony was forbidden from operating its own naval vessels under the Naval Defence Act of 1865. However, in 1879 a militia unit, known as the Naval Artillery was formed to assist in the defence of Fremantle Harbour. The naval artillery unit was made up of ex-Navy men and merchant seamen of good character.The unit was equipped with two brass 6-pounder field guns; these guns had no limbers, restricting their movement. These guns hindered the primary function of the naval artillery, which was to provide a mobile shore battery for the defence of Fremantle Harbour. In 1889 these guns were replaced by two 9-pounder guns, complete with limbers and wagons. The Fremantle Naval Artillery was eventually disbanded and reformed as the Fremantle Artillery Volunteers.Royal Navy in Australialeft|thumb|Ships of the Royal Navys squadron on the Australia Station moored in Sydney in 1880In the years that followed the settlement of Australia in 1788 the Navy did not maintain a permanent force in the new colony. The new Port Jackson colony was placed under the protection of the Indies Station, vessels were detached occasionally to visit the new colony. From 1821 the Royal Navy maintained a permanent man-of-war in the colony. Over the next 20 years the vessels based on Port Jackson included the rates Alligator, Caroline, Conway, Imogene, and Rattlesnake, and the sloops Hyacinth, Pelorus and Zebra.On 25 March 1859 Captain William Loring of Iris was authorised to hoist a commodores blue pennant and to assume command as senior officer of Her Majestys Ships on the Station, this new command was independent of the commander-in-chief in India.Commonwealth Naval Forcesbattlecruiser HMAS AustraliaThe colonies maintained control over their respective navies until 1 March 1901, when the Commonwealth Naval Force was created. Initially, like the colonial forces that proceeded it, this new force also lacked blue-water capable ships, and its creation did not lead to an immediate change in Australian naval policy. In 1909, Prime Minister Deakin, while attending the Imperial Conference in London, sought the British Governments agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an Australian navy. The Admiralty rejected these approaches, suggesting instead that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient. Deakin was unimpressed and had previously invited the American White Fleet to visit Australia in 1908. This visit had fired public enthusiasm for a modern navy and in part led to the order of two 700-ton River-class destroyers. The surge in German naval construction prompted the Admiralty to change their position in 1909(Dennis et al 2008, pp. 466470.) and the Australian Navy was subsequently formed in 1911. On 4 October 1913, the new fleet steamed through Heads, consisting of the battlecruiser HMAS Australia, three light cruisers, and three destroyers, while several other ships were still under construction. And as a consequence the navy entered the First World War as a formidable force.(Macdougall 1991, p. 23.)See also*of Queensland Maritime Defence Force ships*of Royal Australian Navy shipsNotes;Citations;FootnotesReferences***"
"5791422","Mount Meager"," last eruption  410 BC  200 years ago(Mount Meager, originally known as Meager Mountain, is a volcano in the Corridor of southwestern Columbia, Canada. Part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc of western America, its summit is  above level, and is capped by several eroded volcanic edifices. This includes mounds of viscous lava, columns of volcanic rock and overlapping piles of lava flows. Hydrothermal exploration is present at Mount Meager and it is one of the several geothermal sites in British Columbia.Mount Meager is responsible for the largest volcanic eruption in Canada in the past 10,000 years. About 2,350 years ago, an eruption formed a crater on its northeastern flank and sent avalanches of hot ash, rock fragments and gases down the northern flank of the volcano, creating a formation in the River valley. Evidence for more recent volcanic activity has been documented at the volcano, such as springs and earthquakes. Mount Meager has also been the source for several large landslides in the past, including a massive flow in 2010 that swepted down Creek and the Lillooet River.The Volcanic Belt has a long history of eruptions and poses a threat to the surrounding region. Any volcanic hazardranging from landslides to eruptionscould pose a significant risk to humans and wildlife. Even though Mount Meager has not erupted for over 2,000 years, it could again produce a major eruption; if this were to happen, relief efforts would probably be quickly organized. Teams such as the Volcanic Event Notification Plan (IVENP) are prepared to notify people threatened by volcanic eruptions.Geography and geologyRegional settingthumb|left|altMap of the Cascadia subduction zone and location of nearby volcanoes along coastal United States and Canada.|Area of the Cascadia subduction zone, including the Cascade Volcanic Arc (red triangles)Volcanism in the Cascade Volcanic Arc is caused by subduction of the de Fuca Plate under the American Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone.() This is a  long zone running  off the Northwest from California to southwestern British Columbia. The plates move at a relative rate of over  per year at an oblique angle to the subduction zone. Because of the very large fault area, the Cascadia subduction zone can produce large earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 or greater. The interface between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates remains locked for periods of roughly 500 years. During these periods, stress builds up on the interface between the plates and causes uplift of the North American margin. When the plate finally slips, the 500 years of stored energy are released in a massive earthquake.(Unlike most subduction zones worldwide, there is no deep trench present along the margin in Cascadia.() The reason is that the mouth of the River empties directly into the subduction zone and deposits silt at the bottom of the Ocean, burying the oceanic trench. Massive floods from prehistoric Lake Missoula during the Pleistocene also deposited large amounts of sediment into the trench.() However, in common with other subduction zones, the outer margin is slowly being compressed, similar to a giant spring.() When the stored energy is suddenly released by slippage across the fault at irregular intervals, the Cascadia subduction zone can create very large earthquakes, such as the magnitude 9.0 Cascadia earthquake on January 26, 1700.() However, earthquakes along the Cascadia subduction zone are fewer than expected and there is evidence of a decline in volcanic activity over the past few million years. The probable explanation lies in the rate of convergence between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates. These two tectonic plates currently converge  to  per year. This is only about half the rate of convergence from seven million years ago.(Local settingMount Meager is part of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, an extension of the Cascade Volcanic Arc, which extends from the Watts Point volcano in the south to the Caldera in the north.()() This belt includes cones, calderas, stratovolcanoes and volcanoes that have been active in the Holocene period (10,000 years ago to present).()()()() The latest explosive eruption in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt occurred at a crater on the northeastern flank of Mount Meager, which forms a clearly-defined depression.(( At least eight volcanic vents constitute Meager, which erupted mafic, intermediate and felsic magma.( Streams and glaciers have played a significant role in dissecting the massif and its upper slopes are covered by snow and ice.( Numerous feeder dikes to older units are exposed by deep erosion.( Pillar, a vertical tower of brecciated lava, represented an erosional remnant of Meager until its collapse in June 2005.( More than 10 streams drain meltwater from Mount Meager, including Capricorn Creek, Job Creek, No Good Creek, Angel Creek, Devastation Creek, Canyon Creek and Affliction Creek.(The geomorphology of Mount Meager is similar to Peak, another Cascade Arc volcano, located in the state of Washington.() It consists of at least four overlapping stratovolcanoes that become progressively younger from south to north.( As a result, Meager can be classified as a compound/complex volcano, which consists of two or more vents.() With a total volume of , Mount Meager is a long-lived feature, tracing its history back to 2,200,000 years ago.(( This indicates that it is relatively old compared to most volcanoes in the Cascade Arc. In the Range, the oldest volcanoes are generally no more than a million years old.() This includes Rainier (500,000 years),() Peak (27,000 years),() Mount Jefferson (680,000 years),() St. Helens (50,000 years)() and many more.( However, portions of Mount Meager formed in the past million years.( The volcano is made of rocks ranging from rhyodacite to basalt. Rhyodacite forms a series of eroded volcanic plugs, which represent the highest peaks of Meager. Their flanks are covered by their eruptive products and are the surface expressions of intrusions. As a result, they provide a unique opportunity to study the relationships between chambers and their lavas.(A number of summits constitute the Mount Meager massif. The highest and northernmost is Peak with an elevation of .()( Mount Meager itself is  in elevation.( Mountain west of Mount Meager proper rises with an elevation of . Job, , is situated just west of Capricorn Mountain.(( Peak with an elevation of  is south of Capricorn Mountain and Mount Meager proper.( Peak, also known as The Devastator, has an elevation of  and is the lowest and southernmost summit of Mount Meager.((Climate and vegetationMount Meager is situated in the Mountains, a  long range extending from Vancouver to the Panhandle.(() It is about  wide, cut by fjords created by glacial erosion. Because the Coast Mountains are just east of the Pacific Ocean, they have a profound effect on British Columbias climate by forcing moisture-laden air off the ocean. This drops heavy rainfalls on the western slopes where lush forests exist. The precipitation is among the heaviest in North America.(Valleys surrounding Mount Meager contain forests. The area also has wetland habitats, plants of the cottonwood-willow-thimbleberry family and glaucous willowherbs. Wildlife such as wolves, wolverine, moose, raptors, deer, goats and waterfowl inhabit the area, as well as grizzly and black bears.()Human historyNamingThe name Meager Mountain was adopted on May 6, 1924 as labelled on the 1923 British Columbia map 2D. In 1966, the volcano was renamed to Mount Meager. According to a letter written in March 1983, the local name, Cathedral, was duplicated elsewhere, so the mountain was renamed Meager after the creek of that name which lies to the south of it. Meager Creek is in turn named after J.B. Meager, who was an owner of timber licences on the creek.() Despite its official name, Mount Meager is sometimes mistakenly spelled Mount Meagre or Mount Meagher.()Meagers subsidiary peak names were submitted by Canadian mountaineer Neal M. Carter, who was a member of the Columbia Mountaineering Club. Devastator Peak was officially named on August 3, 1977 in association with Devastation Glacier.() Plinth Peak was officially named on September 6, 1951 as identified in Carters 1932 sketch map and article Explorations in the Lillooet River Watershed.() Mount Job and Pylon Peak were both officially named on January 17, 1957 as labelled on Carters 1954 sketch map of the Lillooet River.()() Capricorn Mountain was originally identified as Mount Capricorn in the 1932 Alpine Journal, Vol XXI. According to Carters 1932 Canadian Alpine Journal, Vol XXI, the name chosen for the 8440-foot mountain was Mt. Capricorn, a variation of the all-too-common appellation Goat Mountain, applied by Bert Perkins to the stream which drains the Capricorn glacier at its base. Subsequently, the peak was renamed to Capricorn Mountain on June 22, 1967.()OccupationMount Meager has been investigated as a potential hydrothermal energy resource. At least 16 geothermal sites have been identified in British Columbia, the Mount Meager area being one of the five areas most capable for commercial development. Others include the Hot Springs near the community of Terrace, Cayley near the community of Squamish, Edziza on the Highland and the Lillooet Fault Zone between Lake and the community of Lillooet. At Meager Creek, the potential for commercial development of a 100-200 megawatt station is possible whereas the potential for a 200 megawatt power station at Pebble Creek is very good.() Because Meager Creek and Pebble Creek offer the greatest potential for commercial development, the Mount Meager area is the most promising site for geothermal power development in British Columbia.((Volcanic historyMount Meager and the nearby Elaho Valley volcanic complex collectively have erupted 54 times in the past 2,600,000 years.( Effusive and explosive eruptions have occurred thoughout Meagers 2,200,000 year eruptive history.()()( Four primary eruptive periods in the history of Mount Meager have been identified, with individual eruptions separated by thousands of years.(( Large northwest-southeast trending structures paralleling Lake and the Valley may control volcanic activity at Mount Meager or at least create zones of crustal weakness that are exploited by rising magma batches.(First record of activityDuring the first eruptive period 2,200,000 to 1,900,000 years ago, intermediate to felsic rocks were erupted at the southern end of the massif.(() Basal breccia, which may be an exhumed vent, underlies andesite and tuffs, flows, lava domes and breccia of Devastator Peak.( It has a maximum thickness of  and overlies a  high ridge of bedrock that formed between 251,000,000 and 65,500,000 years ago of the Mesozoic era.(At the southwestern end of Meager, dacite with sparse phenocrysts of quartz, plagioclase and hornblende, represents a  thick remnant of subhorizontal lava flows.(The Devastator and Pylon assemblage eruptive periodsThe seconed eruptive period between 1,900,000 and 500,000 years ago produced rhyodacite tuff, breccia, lavas and domes of The Devastator Assemblage.(( This  thick geological assemblage is located on the south and west flanks of Pylon Peak and Devastator Peak. Its western portion consists of roughly layered tephra while its eastern end represents the lava flows and subvolcanic intrusions of a partly preserved vent. Here, The Devastator Assemblage is massive and steeply truncates basal breccia from the first eruptive period.(Between 1,000,000 and 500,000 years ago, a thick sequence of andesite lava flows were erupted from the volcanic plug of Devastator Peak, creating the Pylon Assemblage.(( With a maximum thickness of over , the Pylon Assemblage forms the largest rock unit comprising Mount Meager.(( The lava flows are normally layered, separated by a thin layer of lapilli tuff and reddened breccia. A concentration of subvolcanic intrusions and coarse volcanic breccia clasts over  in length suggest that Devastator Peak is a major vent.(Formation of the Plinth, Job, Capricorn and Mosaic assemblagesThe forth and final eruptive period 150,000 to less than 3,000 years ago produced rhyodacite lava flows, domes, breccias and subvolcanic intrusions of the Plinth, Job and Capricorn assemblages.(( Around Mount Job, porphyritic hornblende, biotite and quartz rhyodacite lava flows of the Job Assemblage were erupted. They are prominently layered and locally columnar jointed. On the east side of Affliction Glacier, they overlie porphyritic andesite lava flows of the Pylon Assemblage. Later, rhyodacite lava flows of the Capricorn Assembage were erupted and flowed over biotite rhyodacite of the Job Assemblage. The upper  of Capricorn Mountain and Mount Job are formed by these lava flows.(Another sequence of rhyodacite lava flows were subsequently erupted and form the Plinth Assemblage. Mount Meager proper, a massive lava dome or volcanic plug, consists of steeply inclined flow layering and was the southern source of Plinth Assemblage lava flows and breccias. Plinth Peak was also formed during the Plinth Assemblage eruptive stage and is mostly composed of prominent columnar or partly jointed lava flows. Its north ridge and flat-topped summit contain three areas of steep flow layering and subhorizontally oriented columnar jointing. These areas are possibly the remains of volcanic plugs or lava domes that were the northern source of Plinth Assemplage lava flows.( The Mosaic Assemblage, a sparsely porphyritic plagioclase-augite-olivine basalt and trachybasalt formation, also formed during the forth eruptive period 140,000 to less than 90,000 years ago. It is the remains of scoriaceous lava flows, breccias, bombs and lavas.(() The best known and most documented eruption of Mount Meager is a large explosive eruption that occurred 410 BC  200 (about 2400 BP) years ago.( This eruption, which likely reached 5 on the Explosivity Index (VEI), was similar to the eruption of Mount St. Helens.()() It sent a massive Plinian column at least  high into the atmosphere. Prevailing winds carried ash from this explosion eastwards to as far as Alberta. Nearby areas were devastated by heavy fall when parts of the Plinian column collapsed. Later, a series of flows were erupted and travelled  from their source. After this happened, a lava flow was erupted that repeatedly collapsed on Meagers steep flanks, creating a thick welded breccia deposit that blocked the Lillooet River. This created a lake just upstream and later collapsed to produce a massive flood. Large boulders were carried downstream for over , but the destructive floodwaters continued further. After this took place, a small dacite lava flow was erupted, which cooled into well preserved columnar joints.( The entire eruption cycle was erupted from a vent on the northeastern flank of Plinth Peak, which forms a breached volcanic crater.(() This is the latest known eruption of Mount Meager, as well as the largest known Holocene explosive eruption in Canada.() However, it is unknown when this eruption ended.(In 1977, J. A. Westgate suggested that a smaller eruption may have occurred at Mount Meager after the 2400 BP eruption, sending tephra to the southeast. A tephra deposit overlying the River Ash at Otter Creek shows strong genetic relationships with the Bridge River Ash, differing only by its absence of biotite. In earlier publications, this tephra is classified as part of the Bridge River Ash. However, it has been dated to be about 2,000 years old, indicating that this tephra is a few hundred years younger than the Bridge River Ash. Apparent absence of biotite and occurrence well to the south of the Bridge River Ash likewise favour a separate identity.() Large volume, fine grained, debris flows north of the volcano might have been caused by volcanic activity. If this is correct, the knowledge of eruptions at Mount Meager in the past 10,000 years is insufficient.(Recent activityTwo small hot spring clusters are found at Mount Meager, indicating magmatic heat is still present.( These two clusters of hot springs, known as the Meager Creek Hot Springs and Pebble Creek Hot Springs, are most likely related to recent volcanic activity at Mount Meager.(( Meager Creek Hot Springs, the largest in British Columbia, remain free of snow for most of the year.()() The springs at Mount Meager might be evidence of a shallow magma chamber beneath the surface.()Between 1970 and 2005, over 20 small earthquakes were recorded at the volcano. The magnitude of these events were generally no higher than 2.0 on the magnitude scale and they originated  to less than  below the surface.() Other volcanoes in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt with recorded seismicity include Garibaldi, Cayley and Silverthrone Caldera.() Seismic data suggest that these volcanoes still contain active magma chambers, indicating that some Garibaldi Belt volcanoes are probably active, with significant potential hazards.()( The seismic activity corresponds with some of Canadas recently formed volcanoes and with persistent volcanoes that have had major explosive activity throughout their history, such as Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley and Mount Meager.(Threats and preparednessEruptionsBecause Mount Meager is capable of producing highly explosive eruptions, it is an overall dangerous volcano. Many populated areas throughout southern British Columbia and Alberta are threatened by Mount Meager. Pemberton, a community some  downstream from Meager, is also significantly threatened by the volcano.( Because of these concerns, the Survey of Canada is planning to create maps and emergency plans for Mount Meager, as well as Mount Cayley to the south.( If the volcano were to erupt again violently, it would have large-scale effects on the Lillooet River fishery. Another significant eruption would also have massive effects on nearby mining and logging activity.( In addition, Mount Meager is situated in the immediate proximity of a major air traffic route.() Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems.()Souther, a leading authority on geothermal resources and volcanism in the Canadian Cordillera, has stated at present the volcanoes of the Garibaldi Belt are quiet, presumed dead but still not completely cold. But the flare-up of Meager Mountain 2,500 years ago raises the question, Could it happen again? Was the explosive eruption of Meager Mountain the last gasp of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt or only the most recent event in its on-going life? The short answer is nobody really knows for sure. So just in case I sometimes do a quick check of the old hot-spots when I get off the Peak Chair.()Even though very few eruptions in Canada have been witnessed by people, Canada is geologically an area of intense volcanic activity. According to the Geologic Hazards 91 Workshop, priority should be given to eruption impact studies of the two recently active volcanic centres closest to urban areas, Mount Baker and Mount Meager. The former case will require a combined US-Canada-Washington State-B.C. effort.() In addition, Mount Meager is not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active its magma system is.() If it were to erupt, relief efforts could be orchestrated. The Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan (IVENP) was created to outline the notification procedure of some of the main agencies that would be involved in response to an erupting volcano in Canada, an eruption close to the  United States border or any eruption that will have effects in Canada.()Although Mount Meager is a potentially active volcano, as of 2003 there was no evidence of an imminent eruption. Many shallow earthquakes normally occur before a volcano erupts. As magma rises to the surface, it will probably create much more vigour and heat at the regional hot springs, as well as the formation of new springs or fumaroles. These signs generally occur well in advance of a potential eruption, although the possibility of an eruption occurring in the near future is low.()LandslidesMount Meager has been the source for many large landslides in the past 8,000 years. These have flowed down the Lillooet River valley to areas that have become populated in the past 100 years and are now experiencing rapid urban growth. For example, the town of Pemberton has doubled in size since 2003. In addition, it has been argued by scientists that Mount Meager is the most unstable mountain massif in Canada.( It may also be the most active landslide area in Canada.() Because Mount Meager is capable of producing large landslides, Meager Creek valley is probably the most dangerous valley in the Cordillera. Debris flows, mainly from Mount Meager, have filled the valley to a depth of .(Volcano-associated debris flows, known as lahars, are one of the most dangerous hazards associated with volcanoes. They can occur both during an eruption and when a volcano is not erupting. The water that creates lahars can come from melting snow and ice, intense rainfall or the breakout of a summit lake. Large lahars are a potential hazard to many communities downstream from glaciated volcanoes.() In addition, Pemberton is vulnerable to lahars from Mount Meager.( Lahars are also a major hazard at Mount Rainier, a younger but heavily glaciated stratovolcano southeast of Seattle in the central Cascade Volcanic Arc.(()( More than 25 landslides have occurred at Mount Meager in the past 8,000 years.(PrehistoricHistoric2010 landslideOn August 6, 2010, a massive lahar cascaded down from Capricorn Glacier with a speed of  per second.() With a volume of , it is the second largest landslide in Canadian history, exceeded by the Slide, which removed  of rock from Johnson Peak.()( The 2010 landslide at Mount Meager was  wide and  long, creating a dam across Meager Creek and the Lillooet River. This resulted in the creation of a lake just upstream. Fears of the dam collapsing and flooding the Lillooet River valley ended a day after the landslide when part of the dam ruptured and slowly released water. An evacuation alert was rescinded and nearly 1,500 residents were allowed to return to their homes on the weekend after the landslide occurred. No injuries were reported from this landslide.(See also*of volcanoes in Canada*of Cascade volcanoes*of Western CanadaNotes(ReferencesExternal links*************MeagerMeagerMeager"
"2632792","Scapegoat Wilderness","The Scapegoat Wilderness consists of 239,936 acres (971 km) spread across three different National Forests in the state of Montana. Created by an act of Congress in 1972, the wilderness is located in Lewis and Clark, Helena and National Forests. The Scapegoat Wilderness is a part of the 1.5 million acre (6,070 km) Marshall Wilderness Complex as it shares a boundary with the Marshall Wilderness, which in turn is connected to the Bear Wilderness further north.Wilderness Areas do not allow motorized or mechanized vehicles, including bicycles. Although camping and fishing are allowed with proper permit, no roads or buildings are constructed and there is also no logging or mining, in compliance with the 1964 Act. Wilderness areas within National Forests and of Land Management areas also allow hunting in season.The Divide creates the western boundary of the wilderness. Rising as much as   in places, the Wall, a portion of the expansive Mountain Front, stretches a distance of   through the wilderness. With elevations between   or more above sea level, the wilderness lies just west of the Plains, and from the higher mountaintops the views to the east extend for  . The highest peak in the wilderness is Red Mountain . left|250px|thumb|Scapegoat WildernessWith most of the wilderness heavily forested in conifers, the primary tree species found include Spruce, pine, pine and fir. The wolf and grizzly call the wilderness home as do black bears, moose, elk, goats, sheep and deer. Rare sightings of wolverine and lions are possible along with eagles, falcons, swans and pelicans. Eight species of fish inhabit the lakes and streams with trout and Pike being the most common game fish.14 lakes are located in the wilderness as well as the headwaters of the Blackfoot River.Considered an excellent backpacking region, there are over   of trails which generally follow the numerous streams and rivers. Pack trips on horseback are also a popular mode of travel. Located about   northeast of Montana, the best access is from forest service roads off Highway 287 and Montana highways 200 and 83.See also*Wilderness AssociationExternal links* * * "

"868657","The Thumb","thumb|320px|Much of the Thumb is characterized by rolling farmland such as thisThe Thumb is a region and a peninsula of Michigan, so named because the Lower Peninsula is shaped like a mitten; thus the Thumb is the area that looks like the thumb of the mitten. The Thumb is a subregion of the Flint/Tri-Cities region, also branded as the Blue Water Area of Michigan.The counties which constitute the Thumb are those forming the extended peninsula that stretches northward into Huron and Bay. There is no formal declaration for which of these counties are part of the Thumb. However, virtually all common definitions include Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac counties. This definition is almost always extended to include Lapeer and St. Clair counties as well.EconomyThe Thumb region is very flat with fertile soil, the reason for its historical role as a chiefly agricultural area. Major agricultural products are beets, beans,(Saginaw Valley Dry Bean and Sugar Beet Research Farm, State University.) corn, fruits, and fish from the Bay and Huron. Few of the residents commute for work to Detroit or Flint or the Tri-Cities. Large cities in the Thumb area are Port Huron, Lapeer, Marysville, St. Clair, Sandusky, Bad Axe, and Caro. The majority of these cities are in the southern portion of the Thumb.IndustrySee also: of companies based in MichiganThe Thumb has many notable businesses, many linked to agriculture.*Intertape Polymer Group, Inc. has a major factory in Marysville.*Cargill Salt operates a large salt mine and factory in St. Clair.

M-25 starts at the end of I-69/I-94 in Port Huron at the foot of the Water Bridge and ends in Bay City. The whole route is about , and passes through quaint cities and villages. Along M-25 you can see five lighthouses: Gratiot Lighthouse, Sanilac lighthouse, aux Barques Lighthouse, Beach Light, and the Austin Lighthouse.The Lakes Circle Tour is a designated scenic road system connecting all of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.(Great Lakes Circle Tour.) Port Huron in eastern Michigan is a good starting point for the circle tour of Lake Huron. M-25 winds around the Thumb and along the Saginaw Bay to Saginaw and Bay City.

The county is surrounded on three sides by water  Bay and Huron, and has over  of shoreline, from White Rock on Huron to Sebewaing on Bay, and more shoreline parks than any other county in the state. The countys economy relies on agriculture and ranks as one of the top agricultural counties in Michigan. Rich farmland inland produces beans, sugar beets and grain, including most of the worlds supply of navy beans.(Michigan Bean Commission.) Tourism is also important to Huron County with bay front and lakefront towns such as Sebewaing, Caseville, Port Austin, Port Hope, and Harbor Beach, attracting tourists from all over. Huron County borders the Bay and Huron. There are two state parks  State Park and Crescent State Park. Three roadside parks  Jenks Park, Brown Park, and White Rock Park. Also, Huron County maintains nine county parks along the shoreline, which are Caseville Park, Lighthouse Park, Stafford Park, McGraw Park, Philp Park, Port Austin Bird Creek Park, Wagener Park, Oak Beach Park, and Sebewaing Park.The county seat is Bad Axe, located in the center of the county.SanilacThe County of Sanilac has the largest area of land in The Thumb. Like other counties, Sanilac has fertile and flat land, great for growing crops. Towns like Lexington and Port Sanilac bring in many tourists from the Detroit Area. Sandusky is the county seat and largest city.TuscolaLike Huron County, Tuscola is mostly dependent on agriculture. Industries such as sugar refining and ethanol processing, as well as growing various grains and beans, make up most of the economy. Caro, one of the largest cities in The Thumb (the largest if you exclude St. Clair and Lapeer Counties), is named after Egypt and is the county seat. Tuscola County only has  of shoreline along Bay, so it is not as dependent on tourism as the other counties in the area. Tuscola County is economically tied to the surrounding region as well as to the Saginaw, Bay City, and Flint areas.LapeerLapeer County is economically attached to Flint and Detroit. Lapeer derives from the French word for Flint, la pierre. Lapeers economy depends on manufacturing more than agriculture. Although it is landlocked, Lapeer County has many inland bodies of water such as Lake Pleasant, Lake Metamora, Nepessing Lake, Bronson Lake and Barnes Lake. These lakes bring in many campers and tourists. Lapeer Countys geography is very different than any other county in The Thumb.St. ClairSt. Clair County has the largest population in The Thumb. Many residents farther north in The Thumb, especially Sanilac County, travel to Port Huron for shopping and work. It is the farthest county to the east in Michigan, and most of the eastern border is the Clair River, which separates Michigan from Ontario. For the most part, St. Clair County is flat and agriculturally dominating in the north and west, but also has steep hills and small canyons near the Black River, although manufacturing dominates in and around Port Huron. Borderline regionsSome areas of the thumb are debatable, but nearly all definitions will include Huron, Sanilac, and Tuscola Counties, known as the tri-county region. Disputed areas include:*St. Clair County, especially the southern portion.*Lapeer County*Richmond and Northern Macomb County.*Genesee County, although it has a more urban setting, may be seen as part of the thumb peninsula.The Blue Water AreaThe Blue Water Area is a subregion of the thumb, describing St. Clair County, parts of Sanilac County, Northern Macomb County, and Eastern Lapeer County. It is so named because of the Water Bridge and the areas many bodies of water. Sometimes the definition is extended to include all of the Thumb and even Eastern Michigan. A simple definition of the Blue Water Area is the area surrounding Port Huron where residents regularly travel to Port Huron for shopping and work.Discover the BlueDiscover the Blue is a promotion by the Blue Water Area Convention and Visitors Bureau() to attract visitors to the shoreline of eastern Michigan. Communities participating in Discover the Blue range from Algonac (at the southern end of the Thumb) to Port Austin (at the tip of the Thumb).GeographyLand featuresSee also List of Michigan state parks and geography of Michigan.*The Thumbs landscape ranges from a flat sandy plain, that hugs the shores of Lake Huron and Saginaw Bay, to a gently rolling topography, which is fertile and well suited for agriculture. Perhaps, the most unusual geographic formation, however, is a rugged glacial ridge, known collectively, as the Hadley Hills, which extends in a northeasterly direction through the center of The Thumb, from the southwestern portion of the peninsula.*All counties except for Lapeer border the Bay or Huron.*The places with the highest elevation are all associated with the Hadley Hills, and are located in Lapeer County, they are: Pinnacle Point, at , Kerr (Cemetery) Hill, at , both in Hadley Township, Mt Christie, at , in Metamora Township, and a point near Mayville, reaching up to  above sea level.*The lowest place in the Thumb region is in the Saginaw Valley, the far western part of the thumb, at a low  above sea level.*Huron County is very flat and is home to turbines and large fields.*The tip of the Thumb is Aux Barques, between Port Austin and Grindstone City.*Marlette is also called the heart of the Thumb because of its central position on the peninsula.Major riversThe Thumb has many waterways.*River has many branches, one of which flows into the River in the National Wildlife Refuge at  less than  from where the Shiawassee merges with the River to form the River*The Pinnebog, Shebahyonk, and Pigeon Rivers all rise in the center of Huron County and empty into the Bay.*Clair River, connects Huron to Lake St. Clair, and is the farthest east border in Michigan. It forms a low impression in eastern St. Clair County, and has a delta at its mouth (North Americas largest freshwater delta), which includes Island and Island, Ontario. Ferries cross the river at Algonac and Marine City, these being international border crossings.*Black River rises near Minden City and flows into the St. Clair River at Port Huron. The Black River forms a basin in Sanilac County, and northern St. Clair County.*The north branch of the Flint River lies in northern Lapeer County. It rises near North Branch. The southern branch flows through the central and southern portion of Lapeer County, and merges with the North Branch just north of the Holloway Reservoir.History and local cultureSee also: of Michigan history and history of MichiganNaming and founding of the ThumbThe earliest name for the Thumb of Michigan was Skenchioe, which is shown on early maps in  the late 17th century and is of Iroquois origin. Skenchioe was the early home of the Native people called the Fox. There is no definite documentation on the meaning of the name Schenchioe although the name red fox is implied. The Onondaga word for a champain or large plain is uchwuntschios and ganhuntios while sgechnaxen means red fox.Maps from the early 18th century, show the Thumb of Michigan as Le Pays Plat, which is French and means the Flat Country. The British used this name in maps of the late-18th century calling the Thumb of Michigan in English the Flat Country.The Thumb of Michigan county name Tuscola is probably of Chippewa/Ottawa origin and likely means shelf, dish, or plate like landFlat Country. The Chippewa and Ottawa often used bark from a tree or a shell as a plate. Their words tessi aki means plateau, tableland, or flat country. Esse in Chippewa/Ottawa means shell, and essimig means a breast-plate.CulturePersons of European ancestry have formed the overwhelming majority of the population since the late 19th century. The land was settled mostly by English and Scots-Irish immigrants, many of whom arrived from Canada. Other settlers of the same ancestry migrated from eastern states such as New York, Pennsylvania and New England. Later 19th and 20th century residents included Polish and German immigrants who migrated from Europe through the Detroit area. Many of the customs, much of the regional lifestyle, and even the local accent, strongly reflect these origins. Examples are polka shows on local radio stations and the Michigan Polkafest.These European latecomers, arriving many years after the initial waves of arrivals to the Atlantic coast region from Europe, encountered aboriginal peoples for whom many sites in the Thumb were named. The name of Tuscola County was derived from a native word, Saginaw (both the city and county) is taken from an Ojibwe term, and Sanilac, which is the name of a county, is believed to be a Wyandotte name derivation, as well. Among other Thumb place names, Sebewaing is another location with a name derived from the Ojibwe. These tribally-influenced place names greatly outnumber those of any Thumb sites which may have been named with strictly European-influenced words.Historical events*The great Fire took place on September 5, 1881 in the Thumb area of Michigan. The fire, which burned over a million acres (4,000 km) in less than a day, was the consequence of drought, hurricane-force winds, heat, the after-effects of the Huron Fire of 1871 and the ecological damage wrought by the eras logging techniques.*The Lakes Storm of 1913 was a November blizzard with hurricane-force winds which devastated the Lakes Basin in the United States Midwest and the Canadian province of Ontario. The storm battered and overturned ships on four of the five Great Lakes, particularly Huron.*The Port Huron area is one of oldest settlements in the state of Michigan.*Colonial forts such as Gratiot (north of Port Huron) and Fort Sinclair (near present day St. Clair) were built along the St. Clair River.*Bad Axe was named so because Captain Rudolph Papst found an old axe in 1861, when he was clearing land for the present-day Huron County seat.Notable people (by town)More comprehensive lists are available at individual cities, villages, etc. See local towns of interest at the bottom of the page for links.Cass City* H.

"32876640","Informing science","Informing science is a transdiscipline that was established to promote the study of informing processes across a diverse set of academic disciplines, including management information systems, education, business, instructional technology, computer science, communications, psychology, philosophy, library science, information science and many others. Its principal unit of analysis is the informing system, a collection of informers, clients and channels that has been designed or has evolved to serve a particular informing need. The organization created to advance the informing science transdiscipline is the Informing Science Institute (ISI), whose founder, Eli Cohen, proposed the need for field in his article Reconceptualizing Information Systems as a Field of the Transdiscipline Informing Science: From Ugly Duckling to Swan (Cohen, 1999). The ISI presently host an annual conference (Informing Science & Information Technology Education (InSITE)), publishes seven academic journals, and--through its Informing Science Press--has published for dozens of books. Both its journals and books are open access at no cost online, as well as being available for purchase in print form.HistoryInforming science came into being as a transdiscipline around 1998. During that year, two key events occured. The seminal article that defined the field (Cohen, 1999) was accepted for publication and the fields flagship journal--Informing Science: The International Journal of an Emerging Transdiscipline--was launched.The theme of Cohens (1999) article was relatively simple, and resonated with many in the global academic community. In brief, he argued that many different disciplines are studying the same types of of issues: teaching programming, communicating effectively, designing systems to provide information to clients, and so forth, as illustrated in Table 1. This situation was not only inefficient from a research standpoint, but it also tended to promote research silos in which researchers from one discipline were unable to benefit from the research of colleagues in other disciplines. In the long run, he asserted that such a situation would be highly deleterious to our overall understanding of these processes. He expressed particular concern with the situation in his own research discipline, management information systems, which was already becoming fragmented and increasingly irrelevant to practice.  What Cohen proposed as an antidote to this situation was the establishment of an interdisciplinary community of researchers described as follows::The fields that comprise the discipline of Informing Science provide their clientele with information in a form, format and schedule that maximizes its effectiveness (Cohen, 1999, p. 215)During its earliest years, the informing science discipline was particularly focused on issues related to management information systems and information/library science--the fields from which many of its researchers originated. Over time, however, instructional technology became an important area of research, leading to the establishment of additional journals in the informing science in the education and instructional technology areas.In recent years, an effort has been made to further broaden the field. In 2009, the collection Foundations of Informing Science (Gill & Cohen, 2009) was published, including both seminal articles from its journals and new contributions. The collection included chapters related to economics, decision theory, political science, education, design, complexity science and mining.Currently, the informing science field is encouraging interest in research that is not necessarily related to technology. In a recent keynote address given at InSITE 2011 by T. Grandon Gill, the editor-in-chief of the journal Informing Science proposed that the field could be described as follows::Informing Science is the transdisciplinary study of systems that employ information to impact clienteleIn that same address, a number of areas meriting additional research were proposed. These included:# Greater emphasis on informing systems that evolve, as opposed to those that are are created by design# Study of informing through non-symbolic means, such as body language and music, as well as through language and the exchange of coded data# Paying greater attention to the topologies of informing systems as opposed to emphasizing Sender  Receiver communications models whose roots go back to Shannon (Shannon & Weaver, 1949)# Obstacles to informing, such as bias and heuristics, that are particularly challenging when human clients are involved# The relationship of informing systems structure and the complexity of the the message being conveyedInforming SystemsThe basic unit of analysis for informing science is the informing system. According to the original Cohen (1999) article, such systems consist of three components: an informing environment, a delivery system and a task completion system, as shown in Figure 1:The delivery system represented the combination of technological and non-technological elements that comprised the communications channel. The informing environment represented the system components of the system on the informers (senders) side. The task completion system involved the components of the system related to the client (user, receiver) of the information. This particular conception, illustrated in Figure 2, allowed the model map well to Shannons communication model.Topology of Informing SystemsWhile the basic model did, and still does, serve as a useful unit of analysis, it was pointed out that real world informing systems come in many topologies, as illustrated in Figure 3.Among the variations of systems listed are the following (Gill & Bhattacherjee, 2007, p. 19):# Sender and client components are rarely homogeneous. Rather, senders consist of complex informing environments that involve subsystems that may, themselves, be informing systems. The same can be said of clients...# Senders may be members of multiple informing systems that inform different clients. Drucker (1989), for example, refers to the inherent tension that knowledge workers experience as they divide their loyalties between profession (e.g., accounting, law, medicine) and the organization that employs them.# Multiple senders may compete to inform the same client. For example different departments(disciplines) may compete for the same set of students; doctors from different specialties may compete to diagnose the same patients, etc.# Multiple communications pathways may be utilized within the same informing system. For example, an advertising campaign may involve the use of print, broadcast and webbased media in order to reach its entire client base.# Multiple clients may be informed by the same sender, and may have to compete for that senders attention. For example, a patient may find his or her case is neglected as a consequence of the attention a doctor pays to the needs of other patients.# Clients may, themselves, serve as part of an extended informing system. For example, a company may depend heavily on word of mouth advertising to gain new clients.Construction of Informing SystemsGiven the fields origins in management information systems (MIS) research, it is not unexpected that early investigations into, and conceptualizations of, the development of informing systems tended to rely heavily on technology-based experienced. Cohen (1999), for example, viewed informing systems as having three levels:# The informing instance level, where actual informing activities took place.# The construction level, at which new informing instances were created according to the prevailing design templates.# The design level, at which new architectures for informing were realized.As examples, he proposed (Cohen, 1999, p. 217):: (1) teaching a course someone else has designed, (2) designing a course that will be taught by others, and (3) creating a new curriculum. A business example is (1) using an existing transaction processing system (TPS), (2) creating a TPS following general design rules, and (3) creating a new type of TPS.As illustrated in Figure 4, Gill and Bhattacherjee (2007) further expanded the concept with the example of academic informing systems, which can be descibed in terms of two related informing systems that share many of the same clients. The disciplinary system represents the research field with which faculty members and departments are aligned. The institutional system represents the activities of the college or university, primarily focused on informing student clients.  In subsequent publications (e.g., Gill, 2009a), informing science researchers have also begun to address the issue of how such systems can evolve, as opposed to being a pure product of design. The importance of understanding these informal processes for informing system development--even for IT-based systems--has been underscored by the rapid acceptance of technologies such as social media. There is little question that users have adapted these technologies for their own informing purposes in ways far beyond those anticipated by the original designers of the systems.Informing Science ResearchIn informing science, the term transdiscipline refers to the idea that a common problem--in this case the challenges presented by informing--may benefit from the diversity of insights and prespectives offered by multiple disciplines, sometimes referred to as the component disciplines or client disciplines of informing science. To foster such a collaboration among researchers, however, requires extending the notion of of what constitutes research. It has also led to the development of a number of parallel research streams.Extending the Definition of ResearchIn an open letter to the informing science community describing the types of research appropriate for the field, the Editor-in-Chief of Informing Science: The International Journal of an Emerging Transdiscipline T. Grandon Gill made the following statement (Gill, 2009b, p. vi)::The transdisciplinary character of InformSciJ requires that we be willing to publish a broad array of contributions. In many of our client fields, most published research contributions can be characterized as either theory-building or theory-testing. While submissions of this type are, of course, encouraged, we will also consider a broader range of contributions, including::* Synthesis: An existing body of theory and observations are organized into a more cohesive whole. A literature review may fall into this category, but only if it attempts to propose a novel systematic organization for the existing literature.:* Illustration: The meaning or implications of a particular theory are explained and clarified through an illustrative example. In the business literature, for example, nearly all practitioner-directed publications use this technique extensively.:* Unexplained Observation: A rich observation, often having properties not well explained with existing theory, that is offered without serious attempt to incorporate it into theory. It is interesting to note that while research of the form I observed this but I cant explain it would be nearly impossible to publish in any social science journal known to me, such anomalous observations often form the basis for scientific revolution (Kuhn, 1970)such as the Michelson Morley experiment, which paved the way for Einsteins special relativity.: We must never forget that our transdisciplinary mission demands that we view facilitating informing across the client disciplines as an important form of research. Providing a reader in one discipline with a novel perspectiveeven if that perspective is not necessarily novel in the discipline of the authoris a necessary part of transdisciplinary knowledge creation.As a consequence of this expanded view of research, the journals and conferences sponsored by the ISI cover a very broad array of topics, research methods and styles of presentation.Research Themes in Informing ScienceAlthough much of the research in informing science does not fit within simple categories, there have been a number of themes that have captured the particular interest of researchers in the field. These include:* The nature of information and informing: Beginning with a special issue on information science research (Spink, 2000), the ambiguity associated with the use of terms such as information, data and knowledge in different disciplines has been a frequent topic (e.g., Callaos & Callaos, 2002; Knox, 2009).* The nature of complexity and its impact on informing: Efforts have been made both to define complexity more clearly (e.g., Gill & Hicks, 2006) and to better understand its impact on informing processes (e.g., Gill & Cohen, 2008).* Bridging the gap between research a practice: Launched by another special issue (Fitzgerald, 2003), this topic of why academic research is so often ignored by practice has been frequently explored (e.g. Gill & Bhattacherjee, 2007) and is one where the informing science perspective has also started to gain practice in client disciplines (e.g., Myers et al., 2011).* The impact of content delivery (e.g., multimedia, web) on informing processes: Examples include investigations of multimedia (e.g., Sharda, 2005), eLearning (e.g., Sarker & Nicholson, 2005) and adapting channels to highly restrictive informing environments (e.g., Spasic & Nesic, 2009).* Impact of bias, misinformation and disinformation on informing processes: Both theoretical and practical research has been devoted to understanding the role played by bias (e.g., Jamieson & Hyland, 2006), misinformation (Bednar and Welch, 2008; Christozov, Chukova and Mateev, 2009) and deception (e.g., Hutchinson, 2006) in informing processes.* The role of adaptation in informing system design and construction: Moving away from traditional MIS design models, such as the systems development lifecycle (SDLC), researchers have proposed drawing upon alternative metaphors, such as the double helix (e.g., Nissen, Bednar, & Welch, 2007), co-evolution (e.g., Pahl & Newnes, 2007) and approaches grounded in philosophy (e.g., Bednar & Welch, 2009).* The need to broaden approaches to research within client disciplines: Noting that positivist, empirical research methods do not necessarily yield useful results in many client disciplines, many researchers have proposed alternative approaches (e.g., Mende, 2005; Gill, 2011).Consistent with its roots in the MIS and education client disciplines, many articles published in Informing Science: The International Journal of an Emerging Transdiscipline represent the types of research that might also be publishable within the client disciplines themselves. By 2010, however, the editorial policy had evolved. The Editor-in-Chief of the journal commented on the current state of policy in the following statement (Gill, 2010, p. v):: We also continue to publish work from many different disciplines and, particularly welcome, see that many of our articles represent collaborations between authors coming from different disci-plines. Such broad representation and collaboration is the lifeblood of a transdiscipline. It is all too easy for a journal to gravitate towards a particular perspective on research. It is heartening to see that the authors submitting their work to InformSciJ are resisting that tendency.: I am also happy to report that the linkage between our research and the general problem of informing has grown much tighter over the past two years. While there was a time when Inform-SciJ would publish almost any high quality submission from its contributing disciplines (e.g., MIS, education, communications, philosophy, instructional technology), that is no longer the case. Today, every article we publish identifies how its topic relates to informing. I will admit that, in the past, I have been somewhat heavy handed in enforcing that such a linkage be present. Recently, however, I have found authors increasingly taking it upon themselves to relate their findings to informing without my intervention. While the journal has missed the opportunity to publish some excellent work as a result, I am convinced that our long term interests are best served by being true to the central problem that we are studying.As a consequence of the gradual adoption of this policy, recent volumes of the journal have become both slimmer and size and more directly focused on the journals mission.Informing Science InstituteThe principal organizing body for the informing science transdiscipline is the Informing Science Institute (ISI). According to a recently published article (Murphy, 2011, p. 91): :Since its inception, it has published approximately 1,000 articles by over 1,000 authors from over 500 universities all across the globeIn that same article, the ISIs activities were described in informing system terms. These are illustrated in Figure 5.The ISI engages in a broad range of informing activities in support of the informing science transdiscipline. These include journal publications, organizing conferences, publishing books and offering services to members.JournalsThe ISI currently publishes seven journals. These are listed in Table 2. There are several common themes to these journals that have been established by the ISI. These include:* Free open access to the online version of every article is available as soon as each article is accepted for final publication and appropriately formatted* Articles are published under a Commons license, allowing others to freely use their content (with proper attribution)* Printed volumes are produced and made available for sale at the end of each year* Double blind peer review is employed. Editors are required to make mentorship of authors a high priority throughout the review process, however.The ISI family of journals is also somewhat unusual for a U.S.-based research publication in that its authorship is highly international in flavor. As shown in Figure 6, only about a third of its authors have been affiliated with U.S. academic institutions.InSITE ConferencesOne of the principal vehicles through which ISI informs its membership is through its Informing Science and IT Education conferences, held a a different location during June of every year since 2001. Attendance is typically between 100 and 160 participants. Conferences to date have been located as follows (Murphy, 2011, p. 117):* InSITE 2011 - Novi Sad, Serbia* InSITE 2010 - Cassino, Italy* InSITE 2009 - Macon, Georgia, USA* InSITE 2008 - Varna, Bulgaria* InSITE 2007 - Ljubljana, Slovenia* InSITE 2006 - Greater Manchester, England* InSITE 2005 - Flagstaff, Arizona, USA* InSITE 2004 - Rockhampton, Australia* InSITE 2003 - Pori, Finland* InSITE 2002 - Cork, Ireland* InSITE 2001 - Krakow, PolandRecent conferences have included four primary tracks (Murphy, 2011, p. 117-118):* InSITE: Connect consists of study in various locations on the transmission of information across time and across space. Connect focuses on the interrelationship between context (his-torical forces and culture) and information and knowledge transfer.* InSITE: Inform solicits papers in any area that explores issues in effectively and efficiently informing clients through information technology (IT).* InSITE: TeachIT focuses on research topics related to teaching IT, including curricular is-sues, capstone courses, pedagogy, and emerging topics in IT.* InSITE: TeLE focuses on research topics related to using IT to teach. For example, these topics include e-Learning, m-Learning, making classroom teaching more effective, and distance learning.ISI has instituted a fast track process for article submissions to InSITE conferences. After all conference submissions have been reviewed, the editor-in-chiefs of ISIs seven journals identify articles that are of particularly high quality and are also a good fit with the journals mission. Authors of these articles are then offered the opportunity to revise their submission for publication in the journal rather than in the conference proceedings.Informing Science PressThe Informing Science Press is the publishing arm of the ISI. Its catalog of books--all available online for free on Google Books and for purchase--encompass a wide range of subjects. Topics that have been published up through 2009 are summarized in Table 3.Future DirectionsAt the present time, the governing body of the Informing Science Institute is its Fellows. These Fellows traditionally meet during the InSITE conference. Among the plans recently discussed:* The development of an Introduction to Informing Science textbook, to be published in 2012, that will offer a clearer picture of the transdiscipline and its objectives* Future InSITE conferences are planned for Montreal, Canada (2012), Porto, Portugal (2013) and Wollongong, Australia (2014)References* Bednar, P. and Welch, C.

"32884179","Teufelsteich","BESONDERHEITEN  The Teufelsteich was one of the oldest reservoirs in the Mountains of central Germany.It was built in 1697 near Harzgerode and Quedlinburg (in the present state of Saxony-Anhalt) for mining purposes. In 1837/38 it was raised to support silver mining.The Teufelsteich was first linked to the Harz Pond and Ditch System in 1903/04. The Kochsgraben was extended for the last time and it now ended in the catchment area of the Teufelsteich, the Siebengrund bottom. This extension was called the Graben; at the same time the section to Neudorf was drained dry. The Teufelsteich was now supplied with water from the  Lude stream and the Rdelbachgraben along with the nearby mining ponds of the Frstenteich and the Silberhtter Pochwerksteich.In 1947 the pond was used for the first time to supply drinking water. In 1985 the embankment had to be completely replaced. To do this a new dam was built 30 m below the old one and the old dam removed.The new, higher dam consists of a shale body with a clay core in the centre. The retaining capacity of the new dam is around 203,000 m greater. The reservoir now has new facilities such as a spillway, a bottom outlet, a glory hole spillway (Entnahmeturm) with service jetty, a valve house and a pump station.The impounded stream is the Teufelsgrundbach.

Mary insisted that they leave the wild mining town, so the Cozens family relocated to Grand County, where they started a ranch in 1874. The homestead was the first in the Fraser Valley.()  The original ranch house was built of logs and expanded two years later as a stagecoach stop and post office. Six rooms were used as a hotel. At its height the ranch comprised . Mary Cozens willed the property to the Jesuits, who renamed the property Maryvale and use it as a retreat from the 1920s to the 1980s. In 1990 the ranch was restored to its late 1800s condition by the Grand County Historical Association It is operated as a museum.()The Cozens Ranch was placed on the Register of Historic Places on June 9, 1988.(ReferencesExternal links* Grand County Historical Association"

It links seventy sites (including museums, monuments, visitor mines, mining ponds and ditches, reclamations and tourist attractions) connected with the history of mining and settlement in this cross-border region of the Mountains. The educational trail describes the development of what was once the most important tin mining regions in Central Europe. In order to hike the trail, a walking map is recommended that contains detailed maps and short descriptions of the waypoints en route and the opening times of the museums.File:Altenberg Pinge (3) 2006-06-28.jpg|thumb|The Altenberg sinkhole, an important witness to mining history in the Eastern Ore Mountains Location The trail lies about 45 km south of Dresden on the upper slopes of the Eastern Ore Mountains. It is situated immediately on the Czech border and runs from Krupka (Graupen) via Horni Krupka (Obergraupen), the hrka (Mckenberg mountain) and Fojtovice (Voitsdorf) to Frstenau (the hiking trail counting as local border traffic). From Frstenau the path continues through Lwenhain, Geising and Altenberg to Zinnwald. Passing the old border crossing on the B 170 it runs through Cnovec (Vorderzinnwald) before returning to Krupka.

"33077228","List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens","This is a list of fictional creatures and aliens from the universe of the long-running BBC science fiction television series Who, including Torchwood, Sarah Jane Adventures and K-9. It covers alien races and other fictional creatures, but not specific characters. Individual characters are listed in separate articles.Note that some information on the page is taken from spin-off media. The canonicity of this information is often uncertain.09Prisoner ZeroPrisoner Zero is an alien criminal who escaped from a prison guarded by Atraxi. The Atraxi threaten to destroy Earth if Prisoner Zero does not leave. Prisoner Zero stays put. Prisoner Zero is a being that can create a psychic link with people and impersonate whatever they are thinking about. The Doctor uses that ability against Prisoner Zero who gets captured by the Atraxi leaving only the cryptic warning The universe is cracked. The Pandorica will open. Silence will fall...AAbaddonAbaddon, a demon sealed away before time not unlike the Beast from the Who episodes Impossible Planet and Satan Pit (it is described as the son of the great Beast), appears in End of Days, revealed to have been sealed beneath the Rift. The villainous Bilis Manger had schemed to ensure his freedom, manipulating the Torchwood Three crew. Bilis refers to Abaddon as his god.Abaddon killed all those who fell in his shadow; he devoured life. Captain Jack attempted to sacrifice himself by using his immortality to destroy the demon when it tried to absorb too much, leaving Jack dead for days but causing the monster to choke to death.Abaddon is also referred to in Twilight Streets, where Bilis reveals that Abaddon was actually an agent of the Light, sentient light particles that sought to imprison their Dark counterparts back in the rift; the energies Abaddon took from people were simply collateral damage as Abaddon gathered strength for the coming battle. Like all Torchwood spin-off media, the canonicity of these novels in relation to the television series remains open to interpretation.Abaddons design is somewhat reminiscent of the Doctors foe, The Destroyer, most notably in the curved horns, long face, blue, scaly skin and animalistic snout.It is also referred to in Series 2 of Doctor Who by the Ood in the episode The Impossible Planet in terms of Beasts various aliases: Some may call it Abaddon.AbzorbaloffThis alien absorbs any living thing into its body by touch and then digests the organism.Adam SmithAdiposeThe Adipose are aliens composed of living fat, featured in the episode Partners in Crime. Their breeding world, Adipose 3, was lost, causing them to turn to Miss Foster, or Matron Cofelia of the Five Straighten Classabindi Nursery Fleet, Intergalactic Class, to create a new generation. She formulated a drug that would cause human fat (tissue) to morph by parthenogenesis into Adipose children. The process is generally harmless to the host beyond the loss of body fat; in emergencies the process can be accelerated, converting the hosts entire body, which is fatal to the host and produces ill and weak Adipose children.() The Proclamation.() forbids seeding, or breeding aliens, on a level 5 planet such as Earth. Level 5 means pre-warp capabilities, as said in Partners in crime.In the parallel universe created in Turn Left, the Adipose incident happened in America instead of the United Kingdom, as London was destroyed when the Titanic crashed into Buckingham Palace because of the absence of the Doctor (Voyage of the Damned). Over 60 million Americans (roughly 20% of the total population of the United States) were killed in this timeline as a result.In Stolen Earth and Journeys End it is revealed that the breeding planet, Adipose 3, was one of the 27 planets relocated to the Medusa Cascade by the New Dalek Empire. After their defeat, Adipose 3 and the other planets were returned to their original positions.In End of Time, an Adipose is shown in a bar along with other aliens the Tenth Doctor had previously encountered. Five Adipose figures were released as part of the first series 4 wave.AggedorAlien tumourA sentient alien tumour was shown to have grown on the brain of Owens fiance, Katie, in flashback sequences in Fragments. Attempting to operate on the young woman, all doctors present in the room were killed when the alien life form released a rapidly dissipating toxic nerve gas in self-defence. The effects of the tumour caused Katie to exhibit symptoms of early onset disease.Alpha CentauriAlzarianAncient LightsThe Ancient Lights were entities that controlled a universe before the Bang. Surviving the explosion, they endured and eventually passed their power into the human Martin Trueman, a low level middle-aged conman, in of the Stars. The Ancient Lights gave Trueman the power to control all life with an astrological sign, as well as other abilities such as energy blasts. These powers were based on ancient physics from the Lights native universe. Through Trueman, the Lights intended to enslave all life as they had done in their own universe. Luke Smiths artificial birth meant he had no astrological sign and could not be controlled by the Ancient Lights, allowing him to break Truemans hold over the people of Earth. As the Ancient Lights began to fade, Trueman (who had long believed he would have a special destiny) refused to give up his connection and became one with the Lights.AndrogumAnethanAnti-ManAquarbiLike the Greek centaur, these creatures are half-human and half-horse. In the book Pest Control, they are involved in a bitter battle with humans.Arcanus ServitorisThe Arcanus Servitoris is a secret organisation.ArcturusArgolinThe Argolin, who appeared in the Doctor story Leisure Hive by David Fisher, are the inhabitants of Argolis. In 2250, the Argolin, led by Theron, fought and lost a 20-minute nuclear war with the Foamasi. As a result of this war, the Argolin became sterile. They were long-lived, but when they neared the end of their life they aged and declined very rapidly.The Argolin who survived the war put aside their races traditional warlike ways and remade Argolis as the first of the leisure planets, catering to tourists from many worlds. They built a Leisure Hive dedicated to relaxation and cross-cultural understanding; due to radioactive fallout from the war, the Argolin planned to live in the Hive for at least three centuries. Argolis continued to struggle financially, and by 2290 faced possible bankruptcy. A rogue faction of Foamasi known as the West Lodge attempted to purchase the entire planet to use as a criminal base, sabotaging recreation facilities to encourage the Argolin to sell. The criminal nature of the offer was exposed by a Foamasi agent, aided by the Fourth Doctor and Romana.Since the Argolin were sterile, they attempted to renew their race using cloning and tachyonics, but only one of the clones, Pangol, survived to adulthood. Pangol was mentally unstable and obsessed with the Argolins former warrior culture. He attempted to create an army of tachyonic duplicates of himself, but was unsuccessful and was eventually restored to infancy through the same tachyonic technology that had created him.In appearance, Argolin are humanoids with greenish skin. Their heads are covered with what appears to be elaborately coiffed hair capped with small domes covered in beads, which fall off when the Argolin become sick or die.AridianArkanThe Arkan are a race mentioned and briefly glimpsed in Cyberwoman. They are described by Jack as being incredibly boring and mostly made of liquid, hence the cells would be a mess if they were interrogated at Torchwood. One of their leisure ships is spotted over Cardiff Bay. They are politely asked to leave Earths atmosphere via a message from Toshikos computer as they are spooking the locals.AtraxiThe Atraxi are a galactic police force, resembling eyeballs attached to crystalline structures; it is unclear whether these structures are their spaceships or the creatures themselves. These structures also appear briefly in Pandorica Opens.Attention SeekerReferred to as the Attention Seekers by Jack, these are aliens which are viewed as gods, appearing in a 2007 entry to the Torchwood website. Written in a pseudo-blog form, the Cardiffboyoboy blog story relays a young mans series of encounters with Jack Harkness during an alien invasion on the Cardiff gay clubbing scene.()The Attention Seekers are originally a race who are accustomed to worship as deities on their home, which they feed on. They travel place to place and from time to time, masquerading as gods and being worshipped by countless societies until they go out of fashion there. Finding themselves in the comparatively more secular but vain 21st century Britain, Captain Jack explains to the narrator Peter that it has been forced to assume the form of a strikingly beautiful person who draws power from all the attention drawn to them. However, rather than copulate with one man every night, Jack ambiguously describes that the creature ends up in the car park where it can get the serious devotion of a crowd, mentioning how its Odd how people still get on their knees to worship, isnt it?. Jack later explains though, that while it was originally relatively harmless in its activities, it has become increasingly hungry and thereby dangerous, so Jack is forced to kill it with a few clicks of his Time Agent Wrist-Strap, which he uses to trigger car alarms to clear the car park, and later a car explosion to kill the creature.AxonsBBandrilBaneTSJA.jpg|150px|thumb|Davey in his natural Bane form.The Bane, in their natural form, are large tentacled aliens with one eye. They appear in of the Bane and of the Bane. They exhibit some level of mind-reading abilities. Bane Mothers are particularly large and are known to eat members of their young who fail them. They are able to appear human through the use of image translators. The Bane sought to enslave mankind by getting them addicted to the soft drink, Bubble Shock!, which contained organic Bane secretion, which takes control of its human host when activated. Mrs Wormwood headed the Banes disguised human front and created the Archetype, Luke.BannermanBeesA story arc in Series 4 referred to the disappearance of bees, culminating in Stolen Earth, where it was revealed that some bees were aliens from Melissa Majoria who created a path the Doctor could follow to find Earth and the other planets stolen by the Daleks.Blade FinThe Blade Fin was a shark-like creature that prowled the waters around the flooded 23rd century London, now little more than a network of underwater tunnels codenamed Poseidon. When the Doctor and Amy land the TARDIS in Poseidon, the Blade Fin immediately attacks, attempting to ram its way into the glass tunnels. While constantly having to evade the monster, the two slowly unravell the mystery of Poseidon, which has fallen under threat from not only the Blade Fin, but also the Vashta Nerada and otherworldly radiation. They eventually discover that all the anomalies arrived at the city when the Eldridge, an American WWII-era ship which had vanished through a wormhole to another world hundreds of years ago, suddenly jumped back through into the sea several days ago. However, the ship became lodged in the wormhole and held it open, allowing the creatures and the radiation to seep through. The Doctor and Amy travel to the wreckage of the Eldridge and are able to close the wormhole; the Blade Fin is seen being dragged back to its own world, while the other anomalies disappear with it.BlathereenThe Blathereen are a family related to Slitheen, but are orange in colour and do not use skin suits. In the episode The Gift, a family of Slitheen-Blathereen landed on earth with a gift of friendship called rakweed. Mr Smith scans it and announces it harmless until Luke takes a high dose of rakweed spores and goes into a coma. Sarah Jane then confronts the Blathereen with a super soaker full of vinegar. She is captured but escapes using her sonic lipstick. Meanwhile Rani, Clyde and K9 discover that the bell destroys the spores of rakweed by drowning out the sound they make and interfering with their communication. Sarah Jane later uses this to kill the Blathereen.The BlessingIn Miracle Day The Blessing is revealed to be an antipodal geological formation connected to the Earths field running from Shanghai and Buenos Aires. Harkness theorises that it may have been caused by the interaction of Rachnos Huon particles and Silurian hibernation matrixes, though its origins are unknown. The Families are unsure of whether or not to classify the Blessing as alive or not, though it is stated to have a degree of sentience. One of its features is that it has the ability to show an approaching human the content of their own soul, which has caused some to commit suicide, others to find convinction. The Mother believed that this reaction was a result of the Blessing attempting to communicate with the Human Race.In Blood Line it is revealed that the worldwide immortality investigated by Torchwood was a result of Jacks blood being introduced to The Blessings Morphic Field. It is implied that this was a result of the Blessing interpreting The Families interference as a threat, and the subsequent immortality being a gift of kindness to humanity. Jack and Rex (who has been infused with Jacks blood) manage to reset the Miracle through exposing it to Jacks (now mortal) blood at each end of the Blessing. However, The Blessing does not Reset everything back to the way it was and, perhaps as a result of the presence of Jacks blood, brings Rex back as also immortal.BlowfishAn otherwise unnamed, humanoid, bipedal alien blowfish features in Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang. The blowfish, played by Kasey, holds part of Captain Johns puzzle box. It is possible that the Blowfish was known to John. Overcome by Earths pleasures, the blowfish takes cocaine, steals a car and takes a teenage girl hostage, only to attract the attention of Torchwood and the local media,() thus leading to its eventual demise.A young blowfish appears in the episode Fragments, in flashback sequences involving Jacks first mission for the Torchwood Institute, during which Jack captures the fish for committing various crimes but is then outraged when it is shot after being captured.A blowfish and two other fish-like creatures appear in the Magazine short story The Book of Jahi. The blowfish has taken on the name Mr. Glee and has been operating as a crime boss in Cardiff for some time.Brain ParasiteA brain parasite appears in the episode Sins as an intended tool of the Tricksters brigade. According to dialogue within the episode, brain parasites are a metre long with four hooked mandibles around the mouth. They implant their larvae using these hooked mandibles, travel to the brain, and eventually cause insanity.In 1927, the Tricksters Brigade obtained a brain parasite and brought it to America, planning to infect President Roosevelt and drive him insane, which would cause him to eventually drop out of War II and change the timeline. The Torchwood Institute learned of this and sent Jack Harkness to dispose of the parasite, which he did so with the help of Angelo Colasanto.Brain of MorphotonBruydacThe Bruydac feature in the novel, Another Life. Like all Torchwood spin-off media, its canonicity in relation to the television series remains open to interpretation.The Bruydac are a race of bipedal, humanoid aliens hailing from the eponymous planet, Bruydac. They are over 7 feet tall, have broad shoulders and long, thin arms ending in thick claws. They have exposed skulls featuring a bony ridge from the bridge of their nose, to the back of their head. Their eyes are covered by heavy lids and are red and white in colour. Bruydac appear to breathe in much the same way humans do, through their mouths, with their lungs in their chest.They possess slight psychic ability, and are able to possess humans from afar with the aid of a small device inserted into the spine of the victim. When under the control of a Bruydac, a small green-grey starfish-shaped creature begins to grow in the victims stomach which, when at a certain size, is ejected through the victims mouth. If placed in water, the starfish begins to grow. When exposed to oxygen the starfish gains the ability to digest any natural material, including rubber and living tissue.Bruydac ships accept several different forms of fuel, including nuclear, and are cylindrical in shape.In Another Life a Bruydac battle cruiser is slowly pushing its way through the Cardiff Rift causing adverse weather conditions in the entire bay. If the ship were to force its way the entire way through, it would send a wave down the entire Bristol channel comparable to a tsunami. The lone Bruydac warrior aboard the ship, injured after a crash that killed the rest of his crew, is waiting to recover and for a way to power his ship so that he may return home.Butterfly PeopleA translucent humanoid who possessed the body of a 19th century prostitute named Mary was encountered in the episode Greeks Bearing Gifts. She was a member of a race which communicated exclusively via telepathic pendants, and claimed to be a political exile, sent to Earth by a teleporter now in Torchwoods possession. At one point, Mary calls herself Philoctetes, in reference to his exile on Lemnos. She gave her telepathic necklace to Toshiko, and seduced her into letting her into Torchwood to regain the teleporter.On arriving on Earth in 1812, the alien killed her guard and possessed Mary. In this form she needed to consume human hearts to maintain the hosts youth, taking one a year.(Operation Lowry: Notes from Owen) Mary threatened Tosh in order to regain the teleporter and Jack exchanged it for Tosh. However, Jack had reprogrammed the coordinates, sending Mary into the center of the Sun instead of back to her homeworld.In Sarah Jane Adventures episode of the Bane, Jane Smith helps an alien of the same race to find its way home. It is later revealed that this alien was a star poet, from Arcateen V, who gave Sarah Jane a device via which she promised to help her with her poetry whenever she needs it. Mr Smiths Alien Files on the official The Sarah Jane Adventures website described her race as Butterfly People.(BBC - The Sarah Jane Adventures - Mr Smith) The Butterfly People are also referenced in the novel in the Water (published March 2008) where they are called Arcateenians. Like all Torchwood spin-off media, its canonicity in relation to the television series remains unclear.Mary possessed strength large enough to shatter human bones in a manner resembling a gunshot and could move at superhuman speeds, also possessing acute senses able to notice that there was something different about Jack. The poet alien in The Sarah Jane Adventures was able to fly home with some assistance from Sarah Jane Smith. Marys opinions of her human form seemed to be mixed: she disliked watching people talk using conventional speech; which was considered archaic on her home world, but she said she liked the body which she found so soft, so wicked. She also expressed a dim view of human nature, considering humans to be a race who inherently desired to invade others.A letter to Who Magazine noted Marys strong resemblance to Destrii, a companion from the magazines Doctor comic strips. The magazines editors concurred with the observation.() Later, The Torchwood Archives by Russell specified that Destrii and Mary are from the same system. Destriis home planet Oblivion along with Devos, Krant and Arcateen IV, V and VI form the Arcan system.()Butterfly Person or ArcateenianFile:Butterfly Person.jpg|150px|thumb|A Butterfly Person says goodbye to Jane Smith.Jackson witnessed Jane Smiths encounter with a star poet from Arcateen V in of the Bane. This alien gave Sarah Jane a device with which to summon her whenever Sarah Jane needed help with poetry. The same device was later used by Luke Smith to defeat the Bane. Another member of the same species, dubbed Mary, was seen in the Torchwood episode Greeks Bearing Gifts. While Torchwood showed that the race uses pendants to communicate telepathically and that they possess superior strength, speed, senses and the ability to possess humans and shapeshift, Invasion of the Bane also showed they have the ability to fly. Its assumed that most of this race are benevolent, and that Mary, the first of them to have been seen in any series related to Who, was a criminal and an outcast.Mr Smiths Alien Files on the official website described the race as Butterfly People,( although the Torchwood website uses the term Arcateenian. They are also referenced in the Torchwood spin-off novel in the Water, where they are also called Arcateenians. The Torchwood website also claims that Henry Parker from the episode Day in the Death possessed a full-length Arcateenian translation of The Fog by Herbert, which Includes the foreword from the later edition. Extensively footnoted, largely to explain planet-specific references.(BBC - Torchwood - Episodes / Episode 8 / A Day in the Death - Report) This implies that they are, at least in an academic capacity, familiar with Earth culture. Like all spin-off media, its canonicity in relation to the television series remains unclear.CCanisianThe Canisians are a humanoid war-like race which hail from the planet Alpha Canis One. They were led by the renegade Lord, General Tannis. They first appeared in the story Comes to Time.CarrioniteThe Carrionites, as seen in Shakespeare Code, are a race of witch-like beings. The species originates from the Fourteen Stars of the Rexel Planetary Configuration. They use advanced science which appears much like magic and voodoo. The Carrionites use words to manipulate the universe and defy physics. They possess the ability to discover a persons true name; however, when attempting to name the Doctor, the Carrionite Lilith remarked there is no name, but then mentioned Roses name, apparently sensing his connection to her. In the old times of the universe, they were banished through powerful words by the Eternals.The three Carrionites shown in Shakespeare Code were Lilith, Mother Doomfinger and Mother Bloodtide. They are defeated by Shakespeare with the help of the Doctor and Martha, who helped him find the right words to defeat the Carrionites, ending with expelliarmus. The Carrionites were re-trapped in a crystal ball by this. According to Lilith, Shakespeare accidentally released Doomfinger, Bloodtide and Lilith while he was distraught over his son Hamnets death from the Black Plague.According to the audio commentary of the third season of Doctor Who, Carrionites are all female and call each other mother or sister according to their relative ages. In the novel Forever Autumn, it is revealed that they were banished for warring with a similar race, the Hervoken, who also used a science resembling magic.Cash CowA gigantic space whale featured in the episode Meat. The creature fell through the Rift, into the sea, and beached itself. In its helpless state, it was found and stored in a warehouse where it was then cut up and turned into meat to be sold to food companies. When cut up, as well as exhibiting the ability to regenerate, it also showed a visible increase in size with each regeneration. When Torchwood infiltrate the warehouse with the aim of freeing the creature, the scientists forget to inject it with sedative, causing it to flail about wildly, breaking free from its bonds. This leads Owen to ultimately inject the whale with poison, killing it out of mercy.CastrovalvanCatKindThe CatKind are felines in the future that have evolved into humanoids. They are capable of interbreeding with the humans of the future. The CatKind have hair-covered bodies, feline facial features and retractable claws. Their young resemble typical domestic kittens, with humanoid features emerging after ten months.( )In Earth, a group of The CatKind called the Sisters of Plenitude ran a hospital near the city of New New York. In Gridlock, a Cat Person, Thomas Kincade Brannigan, has a human wife and a litter of kittens.CaxtaridsThe Caxtarids are humanoids with metallic red hair and eyes, who appear in the New Adventures novels of the Living Dad and Room with No Doors, both by Orman. They come from the star system 21185, and are expert torturers. Amongst the planets they have conquered is Kapteyn 5, home of more than sixty sentient species including avians and butterfly-people.The Caxtarids were wiped out by a virus that destroyed DNA. This was created by the government to be used against the rebels. The Doctor attempted to prevent its use, but it was activated ten years after his involvement, during another rebellion.A green-eyed Lalandian, who says she is a different caste from the Caxtarids, appears in the Doctor Adventures novel I, by Orman and Blum. The same book states that the Caxtarids (or Ke Caxtari) do not deal in weapons, but do trade in people.Cell 114Cell 114, their official designation, are a race of invasionary aliens. The arm of Cell 114 featured in the episode Sleeper are Sleeper Agents, an advance guard to the main force. The Sleeper Agents are tasked with gathering intelligence. To do so, they hide on their target planet, take on the form of the planets dominant species, and absorb as much knowledge as they can to aid in the invasion. Sleeper Agents can be stationed in excess of 10 years to aid their integration into society.()To aid their hiding, they are provided with an implant able to gather information subconsciously and protect them against potential attacks. In the case of Earth, the implant is hidden in the arm of the human shell. It provides a blade weapon for use in emergencies, an impenetrable nano-metre thick body shield and a technology mask allowing vital signs to be hidden. When the Sleeper Agents first arrive, their memory is erased and stored in part of the implant to help them maintain their disguise. When the invasion is ready to take place, their memories are reactivated, overriding their human personalities and motivations.In Sleeper, the Sleeper Agents are planning to hijack 10 nuclear bombs with the aim of devastating the planet and making it easy for their race to take over.At the end of Sleeper the last Sleeper Agent left alive is asked by Jack when the others are getting to Earth; the dying Agent replies: Theyre already here.ChameleonCheetah PeopleThe Cheetah People were a group of aliens featured in the final episode of Doctor Whos original run, Survival. Like many more recent aliens, such as the Judoon and Hath, the Cheetah People strongly resembled a real animal, cheetahs. The Cheetah People were depicted as savages and had the ability to turn others into Cheetah People, including for a while the Master and Ace. The Cheetah People in Survival had been kidnapping people and taking them to their planet.In the 1996 Doctor Who film that followed the episode, it was implied by his glowing eyes that the Master retained some of the Cheetah Peoples influence.ChelonianThe Chelonians are a race of cybernetic humanoid tortoises who have appeared in various spin-off novels. The first appearance of the Chelonians was in the Doctor New Adventures novel Highest Science by Gareth Roberts. They returned in Zamper and also featured in the Doctor missing adventure Well-Mannered War; as well as in the short stories The Hungry Bomb, Fegovy, and The Body Bank, all by Gareth Roberts and published in the Who Magazine Yearbook 1995, the anthology Decalog 3: Consequences, and the Doctor Who Storybook 2008 respectively. They are also mentioned in the New Adventures books No It Isnt! and Beyond the Sun featuring Bernice Summerfield.The Chelonians are a war-like race from the planet Chelonia. They are hermaphroditic and lay eggs. Some of their cybernetic enhancements include vision and improved hearing. Chelonians consider humans to be parasites and often try to eliminate them. There is a pacifistic faction, however, and at some point following the Doctors recorded encounters with them, they took control and the society began devoting its energies towards flower arrangement. River Song listed the Chelonians amongst the races with fleets orbiting Earth in Pandorica Opens.ChimeraThe Chimera is a creature that features in the comic The Legacy of Torchwood One!. It is a regular human spliced with the DNA of an alien in an attempt to make a hybrid DNA supersoldier for the British Forces to use in the on terror. The being became uncontrollable and escaped, determined on tracking down its creator, Rupert Howarth. The Chimera can smell fear and uses this ability to track down its victims. It increases its victims fear by appearing to them as what they fear most. It is defeated by a special cocktail of drugs, hidden on the Torchwood mainframe.ChimeronChronovoreChulaChula are described in Empty Child/Doctor Dances two-parter as a race of aliens using nanogenes to heal their soldiers in war. Following Captain Jacks theft of a Chula medical ship, thousands of Blitz-era Londoners were converted incorrectly. Jacks ship was also a Chula war ship.Communication fieldA telecommunications field also known as The Light appears in the audiobook Says Hello. It is not to be confused with The Light which appear in Twilight Streets. Like all Torchwood spin-off media, its canonicity in relation to the television series remains open to interpretation.Cowled ghostsThree cowled ghosts appear in the episode Exit Wounds. The ghosts despise humanitys worship of heathen gods and carry large scythes. Despite being described as ghosts, they are completely pervious to bullets and are all three killed by Ianto and Tosh. Their leader is played by Paul Marc Davies, who portrayed the cowled Trickster in Sarah Jane Adventures and the Chieftain of the Futurekind in the 2007 Doctor Who episode Utopia.CrespallionsCrespallions are a blue-skinned humanoid alien race from the planet Crespallion. They were seen in End of the World working on Platform One.CryonCyber-ControllerThe Cyber-Controller was Lumic (the creator of the Cybermen) after being upgraded himself.CyberkingThe Cyberking is a dreadnought class ship with powerful weapons attached to each arm as well as a cyber factory in the chest cavity. It was first seen in The Next Doctor where it intended to convert Victorian London and then the Earth. In and Stone, it was revealed that the Cyberking fell through a crack in time due to the lack of any evidence of the Victorian London attack.CybermanThe Cybermen were originally a race of humanoids originating on Earths twin planet Mondas. As they implanted more and more artificial parts into their bodies, as a means of self-preservation, they became coldly logical and calculating, with emotion all but deleted from their minds. The Cybermen also have a rivalry with the Daleks.In of the Cybermen/Age of Steel of the second revived series, the Cybermen originated from a parallel version of Earth and were created by Lumic, a genius obsessed with immortality. He forcibly upgraded everyone in the parallel earth.They were created by Dr. Pedler (the unofficial scientific advisor to the programme) and Gerry Davis in 1966, first appearing in the serial Tenth Planet. They have since been featured numerous times in their efforts to conquer and convert humanity to cyborgs like themselves.CybermatsCybershadesCydershades were upgraded animals that served as slaves of the Cybermen.CyberwomanDDalek HumansThe Dalek Human race were created by the Cult of Skaro in New York in the year 1930 in of the Daleks. They were human bodies, with Dalek minds inside. The Cult was relying on a gamma strike from the sun to release the energy needed to splice the human and Dalek genomes together. However, Sec, with the Doctors help, wanted to change the process to give them emotions. The other members of the Cult of Skaro believed that Sec was no longer a true Dalek and turned on him. The Doctor held onto the spire of the State Building as the gamma strike occurred, resulting in his Time Lord DNA mixing with the Dalek Humans DNA, giving the Dalek Humans the potential for free will. Dalek Caan deemed the experiment a failure, and put all of the Dalek Humans to death.DalekDalsThe original name for the Daleks.Data GhostA data ghost is an echo of a dead humans last few moments alive. Data ghosts are the result of an imprint of a persons consciousness at the moment of their death, stored on a neural relay incorporated in Commander Lux suits. In in the Library, Data Ghosts appear at the death of Miss Evangelista and Proper Dave. Data Ghosts typically only last up to a few minutes. The Data Ghost of Miss Evangelista was saved onto the Librarys hard-drive as a result of mixed wireless signals. As a result of corruption, the version of Miss Evangelista saved in the librarys computer appeared deformed and possessed superior intelligence. Later in the episode, the Doctor preserves River Songs consciousness using his sonic screwdriver.DavrosDeathA being described only as Death appears in the episode Dead Man Walking. An entity connected to the second Resurrection Gauntlet, it manifests by using Harper as a host after Harkness brings him back to life. A strange energy the Torchwood team is unable to explain gradually overtakes him before releasing itself and taking a physical form: a skeleton shrouded in black vapour. Death then proceeds to undertake a cycle it had attempted once before in the ages when a young girl, Faith, was resurrected by the glove and brought Death into the world in a similar fashion. If Death can kill 13 people, it will walk the world forever, taking victims at random to feed its rapacious hunger. However, before it can reach its 13th victim, the already-dead Owen stalls Death for long enough that it weakens and dissipates: the same way in which Faith defeated Death in the Middle Ages. Owen then re-absorbs the energy so that he may continue living in his undead state.Death was first mentioned as something in the darkness by Suzie Costello in Keep Killing Suzie.Delta MagnanDemonDemons have appeared in Doctor Who several times. Originally in Doctor serial Dmons, in which they were specifically aliens from the planet Dmos who had come to Earth in the distant past and ingrained their existence as myth, with demon Azal summoned at the Masters will.In 2006, both the Doctor series of Doctor Who and its spin-off Torchwood expanded upon a notion of actual malicious supernatural entities existing in the Doctor Who universe. Impossible Planet introduced the Beast, a Satan-like demon remaining from the universe before our own, sealed in planet Krop Tor by the Disciples of Light. Later, in the Torchwood episode End of Days, the mysterious Bilis Manger frees Abaddon, son of the great Beast from within the Rift, where he, like the Beast, had been imprisoned since before time.Earlier in the first series of Torchwood, demonic supernatural entities, referred to by humans as fairies, were established in Small Worlds as a non-alien presence on Earth since before mankind came to exist.DestroyerDidonianDogonThe Dogon are an extraterrestrial species referred to in Shoes. They are a reptilian race with thirteen eyes, each of which grants them especially enhanced perceptions in various respects; the sixth of which is swallowed by Eugene Jones in Random Shoes and after being fatally hit by a car he is able to return as a ghost to look over his life with a fresh perspective. A few years prior to these events a Dogon ship crashed in the Humber and Dogons were subsequently dissected and investigated by Dr. Rajesh Singh under director Yvonne Hartman.A Dogon Eye was mentioned as having been purchased by Henry Parker in Day in the Death.DominatorDoovariThe Doovari are a race of aliens, mentioned on the Torchwood website, who power their spacecraft on sexual energy provided by their incredibly potent crew.()Draconian}DrahvinDrashigDroonThe Droon feature in the novel, Princes. Like all Torchwood spin-off media, its canonicity in relation to the television series remains open to interpretation.The Droon are a species of small extraterrestrial migratory insects, born from pale blue eggs about 2 inches long. Upon arrival, they take up residence in a warm and moist place, most often the sinus passages of humans where they reside in a state. At this point they are relatively harmless, only causing the host mild, cold-like symptoms. Usually, after a few months, the Droon leave of their own accord or die and, during a sneeze, get ejected without the host even knowing.However, occasionally an egg, roughly one in ten, will pupate and begin to advance to the next stage of their life cycle. When a Droon is about to hatch from its egg, it causes sudden elevations in alpha-wave patterns making it easy to judge when a Droon is about to be a threat. When a Droon hatches, it is no longer pale blue, but a dark blue, almost black, insect with long, thin limbs. In this stage of their life, they are more dangerous than their pupal stage.When the Droon are considered dangerous, Torchwood may use their Anti-Droon audio paddle to forcibly extract the Droon from the host.In Border Princes an elderly husband and wife, Mr and Mrs Peeters are infested by the Droon which have to be exterminated before they hatch.DulcianEEknodineThe Eknodines appear in the episode Amys Choice. They are a race of aliens who can inhabit human bodies, keeping them alive for a long time. The Eknodine appear as green eye-stalks that look out of their hosts mouth. The Eknodine attack by breathing a gas upon their victims that turns them to dust.The Eknodine are only seen in the fictional version of Upper Ledworth created by the Dream Lord. However the Doctor recognises them, suggesting they exist in his reality, though entities within dreams ring familiar to the dreamers, as did Mrs. Hammil, along with the entire elderly community of the fictional Upper Ledworth.ElderEntityThe Entity was a gaseous form capable of eating the whole of time and space. In an attempt to stop it, the Doctor had imprisoned it in a vase which he kept in the TARDISs Drawing Room. Amy accidentally broke the vase and released it, and it consequently attempted to devour her. The Doctor warned that he would contain it once again if it did not release her; after it obliged, he let it out into space to feed on Chronomites, tiny krill-like creatures that, after being killed, will rewind and regenerate to the moment before they were killed. This allows the Entity to feed harmlessly for eternity.EternalEveEve is a child from an unknown race of aliens most of whom were destroyed during the Time War. She is humanoid, with pointed ears and red skin, eyes and hair. Eves race can read timelines and manipulate time and have the ability to possess and control humans. In Mad Woman in the Attic, Eve was evacuated to Earth by her parents when their race was destroyed by the Daleks. Her sentient ship, Ship, crashed on a beach at Danemouth, where it ordered Harry, a funfair caretaker, to keep Eve away from civilisation for her to play games until Ship rebooted.ExxilonFFairiesCalled fairies by mankind, Harkness notes that these creatures do not actually have a name. Fairies are not alien life-forms, but have lived alongside humanity since the dawn of time, and although mankind has ascribed positive, friendly aspects to them, Jack insists that they are dangerous. Their exact nature is unclear, although Jack vaguely describes them as part myth, part spirit world and part reality jumbled together, mixed with old moments and emotions, all moving backwards and forwards through time and seen only out of the corner of ones eye.Fairies and children are linked, and Jack says that fairies were once children, taken from various time periods stretching millennia into the past. These children are the Chosen Ones, who the fairies protect and avenge if harm comes to them, until the time that they claim the children for their own. The fairies require these children in order to continue their races existence.In Small Worlds, fairies are seen in two forms: one a small, glowing humanoid form with butterfly-like wings and the other a much larger, more monstrous form. They are also undetectable by technology, and can appear and disappear at will. They also have control of the elements, able to create sudden gales or rainstorms and direct them with pinpoint accuracy. It is also said that they can make great storms, wild seas, and turn the world to ice.A common method of killing their victims is to steal their breath, asphyxiating them by clogging their throats with rose petals. Their ability to move back and forth in time is demonstrated by the appearance of Jasmine, a Chosen One taken in the present, in fairy form in a 1917 photograph.Jack speculates that fairies may be part Mara. However, his noting of Mara as the origin of the word nightmare and their ability to steal the breath from their victims suggests that he is referring to the Mara of Germanic/Scandinavian mythology. It is unclear whether any reference was intended to the Mara of the Who stories Snakedance and Kinda. Bailey, writer of Snakedance and Kinda, was a practising Buddhist and named Doctor Whos Mara after the Buddhist demon Mara.()Throughout Torchwood Declassified, they are referred to interchangeably as maras, shades and fairies.() In the Torchwood websites Alien Autopsy featurette, they are described as demonic fairies.(BBC - Torchwood - Torchwood Declassified - Autopsy Room )Fish PeopleFlesh:Not to be confused with GangersThe Flesh were a group of human clones used by the Sisters of Plenitude for the development of cures for the people of New Earth. They were initially seen incarcerated in pods, but after their release by Cassandra, they began infecting patients in the hospital. Cured of their diseases by the Doctor, they were established as a new form of humanity.FoamasiThe Foamasi are an intelligent, bipedal race of reptiles resembling humanoid chameleons who appeared in the 1980 Doctor story Leisure Hive by David Fisher. The races name is a near-anagram of the word mafioso. The Foamasi fought and won a 20-minute nuclear war with the Argolin. They communicate by means of chirps and clicks, translated by an interpreting device held in the mouth. Although they became mostly a peaceful race from having learned the error of their ways from the devastating war, a renegade faction called the West Lodge exists and frequently attempted to arouse hostilities between the two races.After their victory, the Argolins home planet of Argolis was officially owned by the Foamasi government. Two saboteurs from the West Lodge tried to force the Argolins to sell them the Leisure Hive, so they could use it as a new base. They were thwarted by a group of Foamasi, one claiming to be a member of the Foamasi government, who used a web-spewing gun to ensnare them and return them to their home planet. Some Foamasi disguise themselves as humanoids by fitting into skin-suits which are smaller than the Foamasis own bodies.A Foamasi assassin appears in the Doctor Adventures novel Placebo Effect by Russell. In this novel, it is explained that the Foamasi can fit into disguises smaller than their bodies because their bones are hollow and collapsible.Forest of CheemThe Forest of Cheem is a race of sentient, bipedal trees that are direct descendants of the Old Earth Trees. The trees were sold to the Brotherhood from the Panjassic Asteroid field, who experimented on the trees, and, after hundreds of years the trees grew arms and started walking. Eventually, the entire race of Trees got on their Barkships after they heard the Great Calling, travelling through space for five thousand years. The word cheem means tree in the forests language.(Doctor Who Adventures, Issue 21, 17 -30 Jan 2007) Members of the Forest of Cheem appear in the Doctor episode The End of the World by T Davies. According to the Doctor, they are of huge financial importance due to their land holdings and forests on various planets; and they have roots everywhere.The Forest respect all forms of life, but neither respect nor understand various technologies such as computers. They were aware of the Lords and their fate in the Time War. The Doctor Who Annual 2006 classifies them as one of the higher species who were aware of the course of the Time War and its history-changing effects and also states that they were mortified by the bloodshed.The group of Trees seen on Platform One was led by Jabe Ceth Ceth Jafe (named in Doctor Who: Monsters and Villains), and also included Coffa and Lute. Coffa and Lute appear again in the comic strip story Reunion of Fear in Who - Battles in Time #6.FuturekindThe Futurekind are a barbaric humanoid race with pointed teeth and primitive language skills, who appear in the 2007 episode Utopia, set in the year 100 trillion when the universe is coming to an end. The human survivors describe the Futurekind as what they may become if they do not reach Utopia, though that seems to be just a myth. The Futurekind are aggressive towards normal humans and hunt them for food.GGENIEIn the Books novel Stone Rose, the GENIEs (Genetically Engineered Neural Imagination Engines) are artificial life forms developed by a scientist working in artificial reality. They resemble a cross between a small dragon and a platypus ensconced in a box, and are capable of altering reality and perception according to peoples desires, whether spoken or thought. Lacking free will, they are thus compelled to grant wishes, potentially causing disruption when in the presence of human beings.GangersThe Gangers (a truncation of Doppelgnger) are made from fully programmable material called the Flesh, used to hold the consciousness of a human worker. They were used as a work gang mining aid. After a storm caused them to fully develop personalities (in Jennifers case, fuse with her progenitor), they openly rebelled against their human progenitors on the island. After they were brought to life, they developed unique abilities like being able to stretch out parts of their body, or become a large deadly monster. They could look human with some effort, but really had smooth unnatural skin. The Flesh made a Ganger of the Eleventh Doctor with a Ganger of his companion, Amy Pond, secretly replacing the original, for predominantly the first half of the thirty-second season. A Ganger of her infant, Melody Pond, was used to fool Amy, in Good Man Goes to War.GarmGastropodThe Gastropods, as seen in Twin Dilemma are a race of giant slugs who kidnapped two maths geniuses to pilot their planet into a sun, creating an explosion that will scatter their eggs across the universe.GaztakGee-Jee FlyAn insect native to the planet Varos.Gel GuardGelthThe Gelth appeared in the Doctor episode Unquiet Dead. They were a new race of alien villains that the Doctor and Tyler encountered in the 2005 series. They were the first element of the new series that attracted attention for being too scary. Following complaints, many of which were made by UK, the BBC stated that in future, episodes of that nature would be forewarned by a statement of may not be suitable for under 8s.The Gelth are blue gaseous life-forms. They claimed to have lost their corporeal forms as a consequence of the Time War, though later actions by the Gelth put the truth of this statement in doubt. They arrived on Earth via the spacetime rift at an undertakers house in Cardiff in 1869. Their forms could not be maintained in Earths atmosphere without suspension in a gaseous medium. They proceeded to take possession of recently deceased corpses and in gas pipes common to era households. When they are possessing these corpses, they look close to being ordinary humans (provided that the corpse has yet to enter the autolytic stage of decomposition), with only two fundamental differences: their irises vanish or turn white, and blue veins are clearly visible on their ghastly pale skin. Gelth make an unearthly shrieking noise for an unknown reason, particularly when theyve possessed someone.Claiming to be on the verge of extinction, the Gelth convinced the Doctor to aid their entrance to Earth via Gwyneth, the undertakers servant girl who had developed psychic powers due to growing up near the rift. The Gelth actually numbered in the billions and intended to take the Earth by force, and to use its murdered population as vessels for themselves. The Gelth were thwarted when Gwyneth sacrificed herself, blowing up the building and sealing the rift. Whether all the Gelth that came through the rift perished is unclear.In of Ghosts, Rose asked whether ghostshifting Cybermen might have been Gelth, which the Doctor stated was not the case.Giant MaggotGiant Spider of Metebelis 3GondGorgonGorgons are a parasitic race that resemble ethereal snakes, based on the mythological Gorgon. In of the Gorgon, three members of this species visited Earth through a portal that was opened by a specific talisman. Once there, they remained on the planet for three thousand years, following the loss of the talisman. In order to remain hidden, they formed a sisterhood of nuns that protected them from the human world. Two members of their kind were slain, one by a Greek hero and another by Professor Edgar Nelson-Stanley and his wife, Bea. A single Gorgon remained to look for the talisman, which Bea gave to Luke Smith, who in turn gave it to his adoptive mother Jane Smith.Gorgons inhabit other species and move to successive hosts as each grows weak and dies in order for them to survive. Gorgons attack by means of a process resembling rapid fossilisation, which gives the appearance that the victim has been turned to stone. The Gorgons are native to the planet Gorgos, 100 million light years from Earth.GraskeA Graske is a member of a race of diminutive aliens from the planet Griffoth. They are able to transmat through time and space, abducting individuals out of their own time and replacing them with their own kind in disguise as their victims. A disguised Graske can be identified by an occasional green glow in its eyes.An unnamed Graske appears in the interactive Doctor Who episode of the Graske and the Proms special episode Music of the Spheres.Krislok is a Graske who first appeared in Sarah Jane Adventures episodes Happened to Sarah Jane? and Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith. He became a servant of the Trickster after it saved him from dying, but later gained his freedom.A Graske makes a cameo appearance in an alien bar in End of Time.Great VampireThe Great Vampire is one of the many Vampire lords. It is the last of its kind, the rest of them having been killed by being shot with large metal spears launched by spacegoing warships known as bowships. The Doctor killed the last one with one of the scoutships from the lords tower, actually a grounded space vessel.GroskeGroske look like Graske but are blue. They first appeared in of the Doctor, where they were seen working for UNIT. One of the Groske later saves Clyde, Rani and Santiago. They also talk like the Graske.Groske can detect artron energy (claiming it smells), and dislike the Graske.GuardianHHaemo-gothIn Pandorica Opens, Haemo-goths are the only creatures gathered at Stonehenge, mentioned by River Song, which did not appear in any previous written or television adventure of the Doctor.HaemovoreHaemovores appeared in the Doctor story Curse of Fenric by Briggs. Vampiric creatures that fed on blood, they were the end result of human evolution in a possible far future, caused by millennia of pollution. As part of his final game against the Doctor, the entity known as Fenric transported the most powerful Haemovore, called the Ancient One, through time to Age Northumbria. There it waited, trapped beneath the Sea for centuries, occasionally drawing victims into the water and transforming them into Haemovores.Soon after the transformation, victims appeared much as they did in life, except for elongated fingernails and a corpse-like pallor. Later they became deformed blue-grey humanoids covered in octopus-like suckers. The Ancient One was the least human in appearance; in its own time, it was the last living thing on Earth.During War II, Fenric released the Ancient One. Fenrics plan was that the Ancient One was to release the toxin which would pollute the world and thus create its own future.The Haemovores had the ability to hypnotically paralyse their victims so they could feed and drain them of blood. Not all of their victims were turned into Haemovores, although the selection process was never explained. The Haemovores were impervious to most forms of attack, surviving being shot at close range by a gun at one point. They could be destroyed in the traditional vampire-killing fashion of driving a stake through their chests. They could also be repelled by their victims faith, which formed a psychic barrier, like the Doctors faith in his companions, Aces faith in the Doctor, Captain Sorins faith in the Revolution, and even the Reverend Wainwrights failing faith in God.Ultimately, the Seventh Doctor convinced the Ancient One to turn against Fenric, and it released the toxin within a sealed chamber, destroying itself and Fenrics host. Whether this means that the future the Ancient One came from was averted is not clear, although the Doctor seemed to think so.HandbotsThe Handbots were programmed to help the citizens of Apalapucia with their kindness. Their medicine however would kill any aliens from the outside world. Should the patient refuse to be injected with medicine, the Handbots would crack open their blank faces to shoot out a needle. If the patient dodges the needle, other Handbots then were teleported to help inject the patient. In Girl Who Waited, the TARDIS landed on the planet Apalapucia who was under quarantine due to the outbreak of Chen7, a virus that can kill anyone with two hearts within a day, specifically Apalapucians and the Doctor himself. Pond, who was under quarantine, was chased by the Handbots who tried to give her their kindness.HathAliens that appear as tall, roughly humanoid creatures with fish-like heads, who can breathe in air via the employment of apparatus fitted to their faces that incorporates a canister of green liquid. They are intelligent, emotional creatures  one formed a friendship with Jones, and saved her life at the cost of its own. They seem sentient and while they do not speak a language intelligible to humans, the two races planned to colonize the planet Messaline together. However, they later turned on each other  before their eventual reconciliation, thanks to the Doctors intervention.The Monster Files feature states that the Hath joined and assisted early human space colonisation.(, The Monster Files)The Hath returned for a cameo appearance in the second part of End of Time, where they are seen in an alien bar, and they are seen briefly in The Eleventh Hour in a clip illustrating the Doctors role as protector of the Earth, suggesting that they have visited the planet at some point prior to 2010.HitchhikerA parasitic alien which resides in a human host. Hitchhikers are harmless and may release endorphins into the blood, creating a sensation of euphoria in their hosts.HoixA Hoix features in the episode Exit Wounds; the first time its name has been mentioned on screen, having previously been seen in the Doctor Who episode & Monsters two years before. Owen distracts it by feeding it cigarettes stating that it lives to eat.A Hoix was also mentioned in the novel Twilight Streets.Hop PyleenBrothers from the exalted clifftops of Rex Vox Jax who invented and are copyright holders of Hyposlip Travel Systems. They were guests aboard Platform One to see the Earthdeath spectacle.HordaCarnivorous creatures that crawl on the ground of Leelas World.Heavenly HostKiller androids that resemble Christmas Angels. They are most notably seen in Voyage of the Damned but have also had roles in other serials leading up to Voyage.IIce WarriorInvincible VampireThe so-called Invincible Vampire is listed by Owen Harper on the Torchwood website as being among the people and creatures cryopreserved at Torchwood Three. The specimen reconstitutes itself when dusted; freezing is the only way to stop it.()IsolusThe Isolus is an alien species, a tiny spore-like creature which travels through space, first appearing in the 2006 episode Her. In that episode, one of them was separated from the swarm and the creature wound up on Earth, inhabiting a young English girl named Chloe Webber. The Isolus was confused by Chloes fears of her father and, acting through her, trapped neighbourhood children in Chloes pencil drawings. The Isolus released Chloe when the Doctor showed it the love the human race could produce in the events just before the Summer Olympics. An Isolus is a creature of intense emotion and its sheer need to be together that keeps them alive. In their featuring episode, the Doctor states that, on average, they have a family the size of around 4 billion.JJacondanJagarothThe Jagaroth are an ancient and extinct race of aliens introduced in the Doctor serial of Death. The Doctor remarked that the Jagaroth were a vicious, callous, warlike race whom the universe wont miss. The story reveals that life on Earth moved from being acids in a soup to functioning cells because a Jagaroth space ship exploded on earth 400 million years ago. (Due to an error by production, it should have been 4,000 million years, or 4 billion years ago.)The sole surviving Jagaroth, Scaroth, manipulated human civilisation to advance the species technologically, in an effort to eventually create a time machine which he could use to prevent the initial explosion.JagrafessThe Jagrafess was a large, slimy, creature that attached itself to the ceiling of floor 500 on Satellite Five. It wanted to control the Earth through the use of a news station. The Jagrafess could not survive in extreme heat and was killed after one of the reporters purposely channelled the heat towards floor 500. It had a human servant called the Editor, who called it Max after its full title: the Mighty Jagrafess of the Holy Hadrojassic Maxarodenfoe.JixenJixen are a race of turtle-like warriors which first appeared in the K9 episode Regeneration. They are in a war against the Merons which has gone for centuries across the galaxy. They are able to use sonar type movement that makes them look like theyre shuddering and can emit a sonic wave when they use their high pitched battle cry which renders their enemies defenceless.(K9 Official - Monsters - www.k9official.com)JudoonThe Judoon are galactic alien police resembling rhinoceroses that work for the Shadow Proclamation. They appeared in the series 3 story, of the Judoon, in pursuit of a Veil life form known as Androvax that escaped from a crashed Judoon prison transport. They have relatively low intelligence levels but possess sophisticated technology such as H2O Scoops that are capable of lifting large buildings and Thermal Guns that are able to disintergrate targets.The Judoon first appeared as a major alien in the Doctor Who episode, and Jones as well as the episodes Stolen Earth.KKVIThe KVI are a Russian organisation who feature in the novel Trace Memory. In Russian, KVI stands for Komitet Vnezemnih Issledovanij, or The Committee For Extraterrestrial Research. The chapters in which they feature are set in 1967.KaledThe Dalek were originally Kaled, from the planet Skaro.KarfelonKastrianKindaKorvenThe Korven were green-skinned humanoids with large, wing-like ears, two horns on their heads and four horns on their chin. They were adapted to cold temperatures. The colour of their eyes seemed to change continually. They were usually dark grey, but could change to light grey or red. Each eye could be a different colour. Theyre first appearance was Korven.KraalKrafayisA griffin-like creature that could only be seen by van Gogh in and the Doctor, the Krafayis was rendered blind by unknown means and as a result was abandoned by its own kind. Acting out of loneliness and fear, it lashed out and attacked people before being finally subdued by Vincent with help from the Doctor and Amy. This creature is based on a book written by the Lords as the doctor remembers, when Vincent draws a picture of the beast, that he himself had read the story when he was younger.KrillitaneThe Krillitanes are an alien race that first appeared in the episode School Reunion. They had infiltrated the Deffry Vale school on present day Earth, increasing the intelligence of the pupils with Krillitane oil. Using the children as part of a giant computer program, they hoped to crack the secrets of the Skasis Paradigm, the Universal Theory that would give them control over the basic forces of the universe and turn them into gods. Their scheme was foiled by the Doctor and his companions, though not before they attempted to ask the Doctor to join them in remaking the universe.The Krillitanes are a composite race who pick and choose physical traits they find useful from the species they conquer, incorporating them into their own bodies. When the Doctor last encountered them they looked like humans with very long necks, but by the time of School Reunion, they possessed a bat-like form which they obtained from the conquest of Bessan ten generations prior. However, they were able to maintain a morphic illusion of human form, which could be discarded if needed.A side effect of their rapid evolution made the very oil they were using to enhance the intelligence of Deffry Vales children toxic to their own systems, reacting with them like an acid. As bat creatures, they sleep in a way similar to Earth bats, hanging from a ceiling with wings covering their bodies. Like Earth bats, they are sensitive to loud or high frequency noises, as demonstrated when they were temporarily disabled by the schools fire alarm. They are also carnivorous and have no qualms in devouring other sentient life-forms for food.KrollA giant squid that has been mutated and enlarged due to ingesting one of the pieces of the Key To Time. The green-skinned citizens of the planet worship Kroll as a god.KrotonKrynoidThe Krynoids appeared in the Doctor story Seeds of Doom by Banks Stewart. They are a highly dangerous, sentient form of plant life which are renowned amongst galactic botanists. They spread via seed pods which travel in pairs and are violently hurled through space by frequent volcanic eruptions on their unnamed home planet. The pods when opened are attracted to flesh and are able to infect and mingle their DNA with that of the host, taking over their body and slowly transforming them into a Krynoid. The species can also exert a form of telepathic control over other plant life in the surrounding area, making it suddenly dangerous and deadly to animal-kind. In the later stages of development the Krynoid can also control the vocal cords of its victims and can make itself telepathically sympathetic to humans. Fully grown Krynoids are many meters high and can then release hordes of seed pairs for further colonisation.Two pods arrived on Earth at the South Pole during the prehistoric Pleistocene era and remained dormant in Antarctica until discovered at the end of the twentieth century. One of them hatched after being exposed to ultra-violet light, and took control of a nearby human scientist. The Doctor intervened in the nick of time and ensured the Krynoid was destroyed in a bomb, but the second pod was stolen and taken to the home of millionaire botanist Harrison Chase in England. Chase ensured the germination of the second pod, which overtook his scientific adviser Arnold Keeler, and transformed its subject over time into a virtually full-sized Krynoid. Unable to destroy the creature by other means, and with the danger of a seed release imminent from the massive plant, the Doctor orchestrated an RAF bombing raid to destroy the creature before it could germinate.The Krynoid are also featured in the Doctor audio story for Big Finish entitled Hothouse.Also featured in BBV audios The Root of all Evil, and The Green Man.LLakertyanLampreyLogopolitanThe Logopolitans of the planet Logopolis were featured in the episode of the same name. The Logopolitans were a race of strange looking mathematicians concerned with entropy to make sure death of the universe did not occur. This was disturbed by the Master and the Logopolitons were killed, although the universe was saved.LukoserLurmanMMacraThe Macra first appear in the 1967 Doctor story Macra Terror by Stuart Black. They are an intelligent, giant crab-like species from an unnamed planet colonised by humanity in the future. The Macra invade the control centre of the colony and seize the levers of power without the colonists  including their Pilot  knowing what had happened. Thereafter the Macra only appear at night, when the humans are in their quarters, observing a curfew. They have strong hypnotic powers which alter human perception. They also have the ability to ensure messages are vocalised through electronic apparatus such as television or sensor speakers. Both these tools are used to keep the human colonists under control, believing they are blissfully happy. This provides a cover for the Macra to use the colonists as miners in a vast gas mine. The gas is deadly to the miners but vital to the Macra, enabling them to move more quickly and rejuvenating their abilities. The Doctor effects a revolution on the Macra planet and helps engineer an explosion in the control centre, destroying the Macra in charge.The Macra are also featured in the 2007 episode Gridlock, becoming the only one-off opponent of the Doctor in the classic series to appear in the revived series so far. In the episode, some Macra are found to be alive below New New York, a city of New Earth. They live in the thick fog of exhaust gases on the main motorway under the city, tracking the flying cars by their lights and snatching at them when they get too close. The Doctor says that the species is billions of years old and once developed a small empire as the scourge of this galaxy, but the Macra beneath New New York must have devolved into nothing more than beasts. The status of the Macra beyond Gridlock is yet to be seen.MalmoothThe Malmooth are a race of humanoid insectoids native to the planet Malcassairo, who are all but extinct by the year one hundred trillion. The last surviving member of their race, Chantho, played by Chung, appears in Utopia. A devoted assistant to Professor Yana for seventeen years, when the Professor is revealed to be the Master and proceeds to turn on the Doctor and his companions, Chantho threatens to kill him. He electrocutes her, but she manages to shoot him before dying, forcing him to regenerate.A feature of Chanthos speech is that she starts with chan and ends her sentences with tho. She considers it rude to do otherwise, tantamount to swearing.Physical features of the Malmooth include an insectoid exoskeleton and mandibles, and the ability to survive by drinking their own internal milk.The Eighth Doctor encountered another of the Malmooth during a flashback sequence in IDWs Doctor Who: The Forgotten issue 5.Mandragora HelixMandrelMaraMarshmanMarshspiderThe MasterThe Master was the Doctors old friend, but they soon became enemies during they became adults. He is portrayed by Simm in 2007 - 2010. He first appeared in Claws of Axos in 1971, but by various different actors during the past times.MayflyThe Mayfly is an insectoid creature seen in the episode Reset. It is used by medical research facility The Pharm, run by Professor Aaron Copley as part of a drug that is capable of resetting a human body suffering from normally fatal diseases to a healthy state. However, it eventually kills the host as it reproduces inside the body; at worst, the mayfly kill each other until only one is left. This grows inside the chest until it bursts out, but all human subjects to date have died before they reach that stage. During Torchwoods investigation of The Pharm, Jones is briefly infested with a mayfly, and is the only person to survive because her travels in the TARDIS have apparently improved her immune system. Owen uses the singularity scalpel to remove the mayfly from her body before it can do so itself. After Ianto and Gwen discover the parent mayflies behind the Pharm, Jack has the entire facility destroyed so that the mayflies can no longer be used, and they are allowed to die in peace.MegaraMegropolisMelkeneThe Melkene, referenced in the novel Princes, are an extinct race of advanced aliens, capable of creating exceptionally lifelike artificials. Like all Torchwood spin-off media, its canonicity in relation to the television series remains unclear.During an interplanetary war with a rival species, the Melkene created a race of robots called the Serial G. These robots reach a height of 14 feet and possess a devastatingly powerful heat ray. The Serial Gs fought back against their creators when the war was over and wiped them out before going to ground across the galaxy. In Border Princes, Mr. Dine of The First Senior attacks and destroys a fully functioning Serial G.Men In BlackMen In Black are androids that first appeared in the Doctor serial Dreamland. In Vault of Secrets, Mister Dread and the Alliance of Shades attempts to incinerate the gang, for they refused to hand over a disc required to enter the Vault of Secrets as well as Androvax, who wanted to revive the last survivors of the Veils. Clyde tricks two Men In Black at one point by jumping away from two incineration blasts both fired at, causing the blasts to destroy each other. The gang were able to get Mister Dread to allow Androvax and his race to leave in their ship without any harm by having him beam them into outer space.MenoptraThe Menoptra (spelled Menoptera in the novelisation of the serial) appeared in the Doctor story Web Planet, by Strutton (1965). They are an intelligent, bipedal insectoid species from the planet Vortis. In appearance, they resemble a cross between giant butterflies and bees, with each Menoptra possessing four large wings. They have yellow and black stripes around their bodies and appear to be around six feet tall, but do not seem to have typical insect body parts (such as mandibles or an abdomen).Peaceful and kindly by nature, the Menoptra move in a unique, stylised way and their vocal inflections are stilted. They were very welcoming of the Doctor, Ian, Barbara, and Vicki; but showed an animosity towards their fellow insectoids, the Zarbi, as well as an abhorrence for the Animus, a hostile alien intelligence that had taken over the originally passive Zarbi and almost all of Vortis. Once it was clear that the Doctor was willing to help them defeat the Animus, they were only too glad to assist in any way they could.The assumption is that once the Animus was defeated, the Menoptra, Zarbi and the rest of the inhabitants of Vortis were able to live together in peace.MentiadMentorThe Mentors are an amphibious race native to the planet Thoros Beta. They have two arms with a large tail in place of their lower limbs, and speak to other species through a translation device worn around their necks. The most notable of the Mentors is Sil, whom the Doctor and Peri encountered first on the planet Varos in on Varos, and then again on Thoros Beta in Mindwarp. Both stories were written by Philip Martin. Other Mentors include Lord Kiv, their leader. Typical Mentor business practice includes arms dealing and slave trading. In Mindwarp, Lord Kiv has his brain transplanted into a primitive Mentor body, which has retained the tail sting that modern Mentors no longer have.Midnight EntityAn unnamed and unseen creature, found on the surface of the planet Midnight, an environment supposedly inimical to all life. Described briefly as a shadow glimpsed running across the landscape, it was encountered in Shuttle Bus 50 in Midnight. It violently boarded and took over the body and mind of Sky Silvestry, repeating the speech patterns of the passengers, influencing them, and then consuming the Doctors voice. The shuttles hostess ultimately sacrificed herself by opening a door and sucking them both out of the bus, where Silvestrys body was presumably vaporised by the deadly Xtonic sunlight. Though its hold on the Doctor and the other passengers was broken, the nature and fate of the creature itself remains uncertain. Disturbingly, even the Doctor had no idea what the creature was.MidomarA diminutive race of aliens mentioned on the Torchwood website.() Around 5 cm high, they travel on waves and can reconstruct themselves using energy from the receiver. They are often found in radios.MinotaurA being that feeds on peoples beliefs. When the Doctor meets it, it is completely taken over by its instincs. It does not want to feed on people but it has no choice. It makes an entire fake hotel with someones fear in each room. The Doctor gives this being space to die when he  cuts off the food supply by stopping Amy from trusting him. When the Minotaur feeds, it makes the person worship it and want to be killed by it.MinyanMire BeastMogarianMona LisaThe Mona Lisa is an alien organism that exists in a mineral that was used in paint supplied by Giuseppe Di Cattivo in the 15th century. da Vinci used the paint for his famous Lisa, and when the picture is brought into proximity with Giuseppes notorious painting of The Abomination - a painting considered too terrifying to be seen - both the pictures come to life in Lisas Revenge. In order to release The Abomination, she forced Clyde to draw a key that she could use to turn the key to reality. The Mona Lisa was successful in doing so, but accidently transforms a previous drawing of K-9 to life as well, who locks The Abomination and return all moving paintings to its original positions.MonoidMorestranMorloxMorokMovellanThe Movellans, who made their first and only appearance to date in the Doctor serial of the Daleks, originated from outside the galaxy and were adversaries of the Daleks.The Movellans outwardly resemble physically attractive humans, of various ethnicities and both genders. All of the Movellan androids and gynoids wear white, form-fitting uniforms and wear their hair in silver braids. Being androids, the Movellans are stronger and have more endurance than normal humans. However, the major weakness of the Movellan design is that each androids external power pack, carried on its belt, can be easily removed to completely shut down the android. The power pack circuitry can also be modified, reprogramming the android to obey human orders.They are mentioned again in of the Daleks, as a virus of their invention was central to that storys plot.Moxx of BalhoonOne of the aliens visiting Platform One to witness the destruction of planet Earth.MummyMummies appeared in the Fourth Doctors adventure, of Mars. They were bringing back their leader Sutekh from Mars.MyrkaNNaglonNanogeneNavarinoNesteneThe Nestene are a blob-like aliens who can control all forms of plastic, creating Autons.Night TravellersThe Night Travellers feature in the episode Out of the Rain, portrayed as a travelling circus group in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century. They were described as only appearing at night, and out of the rain. This suggests that some kind of H20 Scoop technology may have been used, but since the Night Travellers were humans, this is unlikely. The Night Travellers stole the breaths of their audiences in order to keep a permanent audience, the people themselves vanishing along with the Night Travellers. However, with the rise of cinema in the 20th Century, travelling circuses diminished, including the Night Travellers. Jack Harkness called them an extinct species. However, the Night Travellers survived on old film reels.The certain Night Travellers in particular were of the Joshua Joy Travelling Show, led by the creepy ringmaster called the Ghostmaker, who carried a silver flask with him to store the captured breath of his victims. He was infatuated with Pearl, whom he describes as a living mermaid due to her deep love and connection with water. The two escape from a film reel played in the Electro Cinema in Cardiff, and begin collecting breaths again to rebuild their lost audience. However, this time, the victims are left alive but severely dehydrated. The Ghostmaker and Pearl decide to bring the other travellers back into the world and continue travelling again. Stealing the film from the workshop of Jonathon Penn, the two go to the Electro Cinema and play the footage, bringing their other companions out - a weightlifter, a pair of clowns, a tattooed man and a pair of jugglers who doubled as firebreathers.However, unbeknownst to the Night Travellers, Jack and Ianto Jones record all of them onto a new film strip. Ianto stole the Ghostmakers silver flask and lures him out into the sunlight. Jack exposes the new film strip to sunlight. Exposed to the light, the Night Travellers are all erased from existence. Seconds before his demise, the Ghostmaker opens the silver flask and casts the captured breaths to the air, destroying all but one breath. Despite their defeat, Jack claimed they could return if more footage of them was recorded. This is also hinted in a final scene of the episode in which a father and son buy an old film reel at a car boot sale. The boy drops the reel which opens, a familiar melody of circus music echoing out, which is heard by Jack. The Ghostmaker was portrayed by Bleach who would go on to play Davros in the finale of Season 4 of Who.Nightmare ManThe Nightmare Man is rather not an alien, but rather a trans-dimensional being who had found a way into Lukes mind in The Nightmare Man. He then fed off of Lukes fear and became real, trapping Luke in the dimension human minds travel to when they dream. The Nightmare Man begins to integrate within other peoples mind, including Clyde and Rani, trapping them as well in separate dreams. However, as fear can only be caused by loneliness in his terms, Luke was able to get Clyde and Rani to imagine a door that led to Luke. There, they tricked The Nightmare Man (after getting his attention for they were together) into trapping himself inside the dimension forever. May be related to the emotion-feeding Pied Piper.NimonNostroviteThe Nostrovites feature in the episode Something Borrowed. Jack describes them as carnivorous alien shape-shifters with a taste for human flesh. Nostrovites hunt in pairs and mate for life. They are most notable for their method of reproduction; after fertilisation, the female passes her eggs to the male, who stores them in a protective pouch in the throat, where they can be passed into a suitable host through a bite. The eggs are incubated within the host until they are ready to hatch; the female then tracks down the host and tears them open to free the offspring. Female Nostrovites are also resilient to injury; one survives being shot with two full clips of bullets, while her mate is killed by only a few shots from Gwen the previous night (Although Owen speculated that she was being driven by maternal rage more than anything else). They only appear to attack living prey: the female does not attack Owen when she realises he is dead. The female adapts to pose as a woman in a black dress, Rhyss mother Brenda and Jack, after only brief encounters with the latter two, suggesting at some slight psychic power (The female also attempted to use Gwens attraction to Jack to put her off-guard by posing as him). However, they are unable to imitate smells; Gwen recognises Rhys real mother by her (disgusting) perfume. When they are revealed as Nostrovites, their eyes turn red and their teeth become elongated and grey.OOgriOgronOlympianOlympians (also known as Gods) were a race of tall near-humans from the planet Olympus and one of the most powerful races in the universe. They were responsible for controlling certain parts of the universe and could change certain things at their will. Olympians were immortal and could never die of old age. They could also use powers on a massive scale including controlling the TARDIS by simply emitting electricity at the console and also appear in a gigantic form amongst clouds which they could then unleash massive amounts of power. All Olympians served Zeus although some were known to go on their own will. They were very advanced however some of their methods were primitive. The Olympian Prometheus was the one responsible for starting life in the universe.The Doctor and K9 met them in the story The Life Bringer which they freed Prometheus and travelled to their home planet.OodOpteraThe Optera appeared in the Doctor story Web Planet by Strutton. These caterpillar-like creatures were once Menoptra, but they elected to instead burrow under the ground and abandon the world of light and flight above. It is implied that they may have been driven there by the malevolent Animus.They have larger eyes than their Menoptra brethren, and have no wings. However, they have numerous arms and appear to hop in a stylised way. They speak with inflection different to that of their bee-like cousins, but their speech is a strange dialect of the language of the upper world and words and phrases they have coined for themselves.At the storys end, the Animus is defeated and the Optera are persuaded to return to the surface, where they look forward to their children learning the joys of flight; implying that once back on the surface the Optera will redevelop wings. It is assumed that all of species indigenous to Vortis are now living peacefully together.OsiranThe Osirans were a powerful alien race who were equal to the Lords and much of whose history became encoded in mythology. Sutekh, a renegade who became evil, was one of them. He was pursued across the galaxy by his brother Horus and was finally defeated on Earth by the combined might of 740 Osirans. Sutekh was trapped in a hidden black pyramid in Egypt, held in place by an energy beam transmitted from a pyramid on Mars. Once the beam was disabled, the Doctor managed to travel back to earth before it released Sutekh and using a control from the TARDIS was able to set the end of the transit tunnel millions of years into the future so when it released Sutekh he was dead.Other mediaIn issue #1 of the IDW published Doctor Who comic book, a Sycorax is collecting near-extinct species to use with shape-shifters for expensive hunts. The Sycorax race also make a return in the Doctor comic strip The Widows Curse, in Who Magazine #395. The DWM comic story is the first appearance of female Sycorax, who seem to operate separately from the males.PParasitic alien tapewormsA race of parasitic alien tapeworms feature in the novel Decay.The parasite starts its life as an egg which hatches in the body of a living creature and lives in the intestines, feeding on the hosts food. At a certain age, or when its host is killed, the parasite turns into a winged creature with two sharp ends. It can impale itself into another creature, lay eggs in the corpse, and leave. A scavenger may devour the corpse, and, unwittingly, the parasite eggs, which would hatch and the life cycle continue. The hosts of the parasite feel extreme hunger, gradually grow slimmer and their weakness makes it possible for them to bring down a fully grown Weevil. Rhys eats one of the eggs, thinking that it is a very effective weight loss pill.PelPeg DollsThe peg dolls are simply small dolls that creep out a young boy (really a Tenza) who can put anything he fears in his cupboard, even people. When people are in the dolls house in the cupboard the dolls want to play, and do so by chasing them and turning them into dolls by touch. However, when the boy can face his fears, all the people in the cupboard go back to where they were before, even if they were turned into a doll. (Night Terrors)Pied PiperBased on the mythical piper in the fairytale, the Pied Piper was an energy entity from the Jeggorabax Cluster, home to beings that feed on emotions. The species spacecraft resembled meteorites; one such ship crash landed on Earth in the Weserbergland Mountains, Saxony in 1283. Feeding off the emotion of fear, it assumed the human disguise of Pied Piper and stole away all the children of the town of Hamelin, creating fear from parents.The Doctor, and Gillian first meet the Pied Piper in the comic Challenge of the Piper. This is also the first story to ever feature the Pied Piper in Doctor Who. Over the centuries, the creature continued to abduct children and terrify their parents, using many guises including Odd Bob the Clown, who kidnapped children in wartime New York. In the 2009 story Day of the Clown, posing as both the ringmaster Elijah Spellman and as Odd Bob, the entity established a museum in Ealing named Spellmans Magical Museum of the Circus, made possible by the presence of the Weserbergland Meteorite at the Pharos Institute. Because of Sarah Janes affiliation with Pharos, she broke some of the meteorite and used it to trap the alien in it, after having weakened it by laughing at its clown form instead of fearing it. The meteorite was then sealed in a special emotion-proof container made out of Halconite steel in Sarah Janes attic.Pig slaveIn in Manhattan and of the Daleks (2007), the of Skaro experimented on humans and turned them into Pig Slaves if they possessed a low level of intelligence. Just why the Daleks chose such a form for their slaves is unknown. The Pig Slaves captured subjects for the Dalek experiments, taking them through the sewers of Manhattan to the basement of the State Building. Some pigs hid in the Broadway theatre where the showgirl Tallulah performed. Tallulah later sees her missing boyfriend, Laszlo, but does not immediately recognise him because he has been mutated into a half-pig/half-man form. Laszlo still retains most of his memory and personality since he managed to escape from the Daleks before the process could be completed. He leaves a single white rose for Tallulah in her room each night before her performance and is able to resist the Daleks, unlike the other mutants. True Pig Slaves are extremely aggressive and savage creatures, and according to Laszlo, capable of slitting a throat with their bare teeth. However, they are also vulnerable and have very short lifespans, only surviving a few weeks.The Torchwood Institute website states that 1930s New York suffered an infestation similar to the Weevil infestation of Cardiff in the late 2000s, and that it was covered up by rumours of crocodiles.() This is presumably intended by the websites producers to tie in the New Yorks Pig Slave infestation of Daleks in Manhattan with the stories of the Torchwood universe.PlasmavorePlasmavores are shape-changing aliens that live on haemoglobin. They absorb blood from their victims, which in turn changes their own blood chemistry to that of the victim, allowing them to mimic other species when medically scanned. A Plasmavore was hiding from the Judoon in the Royal Hope Hospital on Earth, disguised as Florence Finnegan.PrimordPrimords were humans mutated by slime produced as a by-product of Project Inferno. The creatures were never actually called Primords in the story, although they were credited as such. In some circumstances, the infection could be transmitted if a Primord touched a human and heat would cause the transformation to progress at a more rapid pace. Primords were resistant to pistol fire, although they could be injured by repeated rifle fire and killed by sudden drops in temperature or in falls. The degree of intelligence displayed by the Primords was variable; they acted primarily on instinct, but displayed signs of organisation and tactics, especially in the early stages. They made a high-pitched, screeching sound, which the Doctor claimed that he had heard during the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883, suggesting that he had encountered, or at least heard, the creatures before.Prisoner ZeroPrizoner Zero is a shapeshifting alien resembling an viperfish that hid from the Atraxi in the house of Pond for twelve years in a room she never noticed. In its normal form, it hangs from the ceiling.ProamonPterodactylThe Torchwood Three team keeps a pterodactyl as a pet (specifically, a Pteranodon). It is first seen in Everything Changes, flying inside the Torchwood Hub as well as in the skies over Dahl Plass at the end of the episode. The cast and crew have nicknamed the pterodactyl Myfanwy.() On the Torchwood website, the characters also refer to the pterodactyl by the name Myfanwy.(BBC - Torchwood - Messages) The creature came through the Cardiff spacetime Rift and began eating sheep, only to be captured by Torchwood and subsequently socialized. It is also nocturnal, and is content to come and go at night, with a few sightings which thus far have not caused any concern, except for a few missing sheep in Barry which have been attributed to panthers on the loose,(Torchwood External Hub Interface - Pterodactyl) a reference to cat sightings especially common in West England and Wales.In Cyberwoman it is revealed that the team use a special type of barbecue sauce (the website describes it as a special protein sauce) to help it identify what food is safe for it to eat. While it proved capable of fighting a Cyberman it was not seen again in the first series, leading to the assumption that the Cyberwoman killed it, but this proved not to be the case, as it had a cameo appearance in the 2nd series episode Meat.In flashback scenes in Fragments the Pteranodon is seen again when Ianto joins Torchwood by helping Captain Jack capture it, Jack deciding to keep it as a watchdog.PwccmThe same race as Abaddon, Pwccm features in the novel Twilight Streets as the master of the Dark before his destruction by Abaddon in their final battle.PyrovileThe Pyroviles are a race of aliens which appeared in the episode Fires of Pompeii. With a stone skin held together by living magma, their shape resembles Roman Centurions. One of their ships fell to Earth thousands of years ago, shattering them into dust. The earthquake that caused Vesuvius to erupt in the year 79 re-awakened them, and they possessed human hosts in nearby Pompeii. These hosts helped the few adult Pyroviles who had survived to construct an energy conversion matrix to use lava inside Vesuvius to conquer Earth and power the conversion of the whole human race into adult Pyroviles in order to replace their homeworld of Pyrovilia, which was lost. Throwing water over them is fatal, since it causes their magma to cool. They are also capable of breathing fire; their breath is shown as powerful enough to incinerate a human in seconds. The invading Pyroviles were supposedly destroyed in the AD 79 eruption of Vesuvius.In Stolen Earth/Journeys End, it is revealed that Pyrovilia was among the 27 planets snatched into the Medusa Cascade by the New Dalek Empire. After their defeat, all the planets were returned to their rightful places. With the reappearance of their homeworld, there may be hope for any remaining Pyroviles.QRRaakThe Raak was a sea monster experimented on by Crozier in Mindwarp (1986).RacnossThe Racnoss appeared in the Doctor story The Runaway Bride in 2006.The Racnoss were an ancient race of aliens from the Dark Times of the universe. Half-humanoid, half-arachnid in appearance, they were an invasion force who consumed everything on the planets they conquered. Their race was wiped out by the Fledgeling Empires, including the Lords, over 4.6 billion years ago. Nearly all of the survivors of the race escaped in their ship to where the Earth would later form, serving in place of a planetesimal as its core, hibernating for billions of years, with the exception of their Empress. She would later come to Earth in her ship, the Webstar, seeking to use the Huon particles which had been recreated by the Institute as a means of resurrecting her children before feasting on the human population of Earth. The last Racnoss were presumed wiped out when the Doctor drained the waters of the Thames down the shaft leading to their ship; the Empress was killed when her own ship was destroyed by the British army at the order of Saxon.The Empress appears briefly in a flashback in Turn Left. In the parallel universe created by Donna Noble, she has still been defeated, but the Doctor, taking too long to escape without Donnas assistance, was drowned and died with her, the water killing him too quickly for him to regenerate, causing the Earth to become a dystopia over the next few years.RaxacoricofallapatoriansNative to Raxacoricofallapatorius, Raxacoricofallapatorians are grouped by extended family names which are sometimes used to refer to their species generically. They hatch from eggs and are composed of living calcium. Capital punishment is practised on the home world, which involves immersion of convicted criminals in acid that slowly dissolves them while still alive.The Slitheen family are a ruthless criminal sect motivated by profit. Convicted for their crimes on Raxacoricofallapatorius, they face execution if they return.The Blathereen family are sworn enemies of the Slitheen, and have infiltrated the prison on the planet Justicia.(BBC BOOK, The Monsters Inside)A Raxacoricofallapatorian makes a cameo appearance in an alien bar in End of Time.ReaperReapers appeared in the Doctor episode Fathers Day, written by Cornell. Although not named on screen, they were referred to as Reapers in the publicity material for the episode. The production team based their design on the Reaper, with their tails shaped like scythes.Reapers are multi-limbed, flying creatures similar to pterosaurs, with a large wingspan, sharp teeth both in the form of a beak and a secondary mouth in their torsos, coupled with a rapacious attitude. The Reapers are apparently extradimensional, materialising and dematerialising out of the spacetime vortex. They are attracted to temporal paradoxes that damage time, like bacteria swarming around a wound. They then proceed to sterilise the wound by consuming everyone in sight.Once in this dimension, however, they can be blocked by material barriers. The older the barriers, the more effective they are, but even the oldest of barriers cannot stop them forever. Paradoxes can also allow them to directly materialise at the spot of the paradox. If the timeline is restored, they vanish, with their actions reversed as if they had never happened.In Fathers Day, the Doctor explained that when the Lords were still around, there were laws to prevent the spread of paradoxes and that such paradoxes could be repaired. This implies that the Reapers are a natural phenomenon whose manifestation could be prevented if the paradox was resolved quickly. However, with the elimination of the other Time Lords in the Time War, there was no longer any agency that could repair time.RefusianRillRitual motorcyclesA pair of organic motorcycles with AI brains feature in the comic Jetsam. The bikes are used in a ritual by a race of aliens to settle minor conflicts such as wars and border disputes. The bikes allow the user to harness their childhood fears to aid their courage in combat. In Jetsam, a pair of bikes get washed ashore after a shipwreck. One possesses Toshiko who, having fought free of the bikes control, convinces her combatant, the leader of a local bike gang, to surrender. However, when the biker tries to stab Toshiko, the bike kills him for breaking the agreement.RutanSSand beastSavageScarecrowStraw-filled foot soldiers created by Son of Mine, using molecular fringe animation. They were relentless and untiring, with rudimentary intelligence. Even after being cut down by machine-gun fire, they could be reanimated.Another type of scarecrow which came alive were set to appear in the unmade movie Doctor Who Meets Scratchman.Sea DevilSea Devils were turtle-like humanoids that lived in Earths oceans millions of years before humans evolved. They believed that a small planet would crash into Earth, which became Earths moon. Like the Silurians, they went into hibernation and wanted to take the planet back from humans when they awoke.Seaweed creatureSelachian The Selachain are a marine race that physically resemble salmon but have developed armour that allows them to breath on land and wear helmets carved to resemble sharks as psychological warfare tactic.SensoriteSerfianGiant insect or beetle type species. First mentioned in Pest Control (audio book). Dr Lanovia said that she found the eggs laying in a ditch. She placed the eggs in the militaries inoculations. The eggs began to incubate in the human body, eventually the insects destroyed their human host.Sex gasAn unnamed gaseous alien parasite that comes to Earth to feed on orgasmic energy in Day One. Composed of vorax and ceranium gases, Earths atmosphere is poisonous to the alien, so it needs to take a human host to survive for prolonged periods. It vies for control with its host, causing physiological changes that will eventually cause the hosts internal organs to explode.The alien also makes its host secrete a blend of ultra-powerful pheromones that cause tremendous sexual attraction in those around it for the purposes of feeding. Coupling with the host is fatal, causing the hosts partner to disintegrate into a pile of dust at climax and allowing the alien to absorb the energy from the orgasm.The BBC Torchwood website lists it as the Sex gas. Producer T Davies,( in the documentary series Torchwood Declassified, refers to it as a sex monster.()ShalkaThe Shalka appear to be a serpentine alien race made of living rock and magma, but they are actually bioplasmic entities, living plasma, their physical appearance merely a crust concealing their true forms. They breathe volcanic air and prefer high temperatures, being most comfortable underground where lava meets rock. They communicate through high-pitched screaming, which they can use for a variety of effects, like tunnelling through rock or mentally controlling other life forms. They also use sound as a part of their technology.In an alternate timeline, the Shalka arrived on Earth via meteorite, initially landing near Ruapehu, New Zealand, subsequently establishing a beachhead for their planned invasion of Earth beneath the Lancashire town of Lannet. They also created a stable wormhole for landing their invasion force, which could also be converted into a hole to dispose of their enemies, as they tried to do with the Doctor.As they claimed to have done to billions of planets before, they intended to implant Shalka larvae into key segments of the population, mind controlling them into emitting a scream that would destroy the layer. In this way, the Shalka intended to raise the surface temperature of the planet to the point where the human race would perish but the Shalka could thrive. The Shalka would then live beneath the surface, with the rest of the universe believing that Earths inhabitants had died of self-inflicted ecological damage. The Doctor defeated their plans with the help of the British military and a Lannet barmaid named Alison.They are not technically Doctor Who monsters since they appeared in a failed attempt to restart the series before it was permanently revived.ShambonieAn alien race said to have big foreheads.ShansheethThe Shansheeth are a race of vulture-like aliens which appear in of the Doctor by Russell T Davies. A fleet of Shansheeth announce to Sarah Jane via UNIT the death of the Doctor, and take charge of the funeral procession; Mr Smith confirms their status as the undertakers of the universe, finding fallen heroes on battlefields. However, the band of Shansheeth Sarah Jane and former companion Jo Jones (Manning) encounter want to use the companions memories of the Doctor, in conjunction with their Memory Weave device to create a TARDIS key with which they can steal the TARDIS and prevent death across the timeline. Sarah and Jo, instead, overload the device, which blows up and destroys the Shansheeth along with their UNIT accomplice. The main branch of the Shansheeth later apologise to Sarah Jane for the actions of this rogue group.ShrivenzaleSimonSimon was an alien mentioned on the Torchwood website, specifically in an article attached to, and especially in, Amanda Davies diary. He was travelling on Earth, seeking to discover the source of life. He wandered into a countryside village and was taken in by the Davies family. Simon, having based his appearance on Jon Bon Jovi, near-instantly seduced the familys daughter - Amanda, and ultimately left her pregnant with an alien baby (which itself quickly developed, and began to degrade her health). Simon then disappeared around the same time as Jack Harkness arrived (implying he had been captured or killed by Torchwood), and later Jack met with Amandas father and (apparently) made an agreement to have the entire village, including Amanda, subjected to amnesia pills, have all records and evidence that the Davies existed in the village (including Amandas diary) confiscated, have the alien baby removed before Amanda died, and then send the Davies family away with a new identity.The First SeniorThe First Senior is an organization from an alien planet featured in the novel Princes. Like all Torchwood spin-off media, its canonicity in relation to the television series remains open to interpretation.The race that inhabit the planet are described as shades, wraith-like shadows covered in thorns. This is their true form but they are able to take on any shape they desire. When taking on a different form, they dont just change appearance, but physically change into the object they are copying. However, when not inhabiting their true form, they lose many of the advantages that stem from it including near invisibility and extreme speed. They do however retain superior strength and an excellent fighting ability. This is evident by the fact a shade can take on a fully functional Serial G unit, and crush The Amok with its bare hands.Despite being gaseous, they have sentient robotic brains capable of and downloading information from a central server on their planet and performing complex calculations.Similar to Torchwood Three, The First Senior monitor the Rift, at another of its anchor points on their planet. However, their organization is a lot more advanced than Torchwood; on their home planet, they have an entire family dedicated to guarding the Rift (the Border to them), led by the Border Prince.When The First Senior discovered the existence of Torchwood, out of curiosity, they sent in an agent known as The Principal. The Principal took the guise of a human, James Mayer, who inserted himself into Torchwood by implanting himself into the teams memories, making them believe he had always been a member. The First Senior then erased The Principals own memories so that he couldnt inadvertently reveal his true identity.Also inserted onto Earth was a protector for The Principal, Mr Dine. Mr Dine made sure The Principal didnt come to any harm and that The Principal was efficiently recalled when his time with Torchwood was over. When The Principal is to be recalled, he regains his memory, through a computer signal, and all memories of him are removed from people he has interacted with, through the removal of a 100 mile wide memory-creation radius.SilurianSisterhood of KarnSkithThe Skith are ice-based, telepathic aliens. They see themselves as explorers and seekers of knowledge, but their methodology is to pull information from the minds of others. They appear as humanoid figures made of blue ice, except the Skith Leader, who is a larger figure made of red ice, and the Mindcore, which transmits telepathic information to and from the Worldmind on their homeworld, and resembles a giant, tentacled head, made out of blue ice. Those infected by Skith telepathic ice gradually become Skith-like drones themselves.They first appeared in the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip The First (#s 385389), where they are based at the South Pole, and intercept the Shackleton expedition, before being stopped by the Tenth Doctor and Martha Jones. In the story Age of Ice (#s 408410), the surviving Skith Leader reappears in present-day Australia, when he believes his people have come to rescue him. However, in the time that has passed since The First, the Skith philosophy has changed, and they are now initialising a fullscale invasion. Based on the information absorbed from the Doctors mind in the earlier story, they have constructed a duplicate TARDIS.In The Crimson Hand (#s 416420), it is revealed that the first action of the Hand was to destroy the Skith Throneworld.SkonnanSlitheenThe Slitheen are a family of massive, bipedal extraterrestrials. They are creatures of living calcium, hatched from eggs and native to the planet Raxacoricofallapatorius. While, strictly speaking, the name Slitheen refers to a specific family, the term has been used by the Doctor to refer to the Raxacoricofallapatorian race in general.The Slitheen have appeared in the Doctor Who episodes of London, War Three and Town and the interactive episode, of the Graske. Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love, a mini episode of The Sarah Jane Adventures for Comic Relief, featured Corbett as a small Slitheen.SlitheenThe Slitheen are a family of large bipedial extraterrestrials. They first appeared in Aliens of London and World War Three (both in 2005). The Slitheen are able to wear a humans skin as a disguise; in Aliens of London they use the Prime Ministers skin to attempt to take over the British government. The Slitheen are mostly made of calcium so they have a weakness to acid (vinegar).SlytherThe Slyther was a monster that served the Daleks. It was seen in episodes four and five of Dalek Invasion of Earth (1964), guarding the Dalek mines in Bedfordshire. After the Slyther attacked a small group of humans, killing Ashton, Ian hit it with a rock, causing it to fall down a pit to its death.Smilers/Winders, TheThe Smilers are androids which are mounted inside booths across Starship UK (a country which abandoned the Earth after a series of dangerous flares in the 29th century). The Smilers rotate their heads to show three faces; happy, warning or very dangerous. They let the people of Starship UK know whats good and whats bad, and if the Starship is under a security threat, The Smilers can leave their booths and move around.SolonianSontaranSontaransThe Sontarans were referred to in of the Gorgon by Bea who said they looked like a huge potato with a radar. Commander Kaagh appears in Series 2 in the story Last Sontaran after the destruction of his battle fleet as well as the death of the other Sontarans on board in the Who two-parter episodes Sontaran Strategem and Poison Sky. He returns in of the Bane, where he sides up with Mrs Wormwood, the recurring Bane. In the end, he sacrifices himself to foil her plans of the destruction of Earth.SpiridonThe Spiridons featured in the serial of the Daleks (1973). They were the dominant species of sentient humanoids on planet Spiridon in the Ninth System. They had developed a form of invisibility but became visible after death. They had been subjugated, to be used as experimental subjects and slaves, by the Daleks who were attempting to discover the secret of the Spiridons invisibility and reproduce it for their own use. Some of the Spiridons, including one called Wester, resisted. They wore furs to keep themselves warm. The Doctor returns to Spiridon in spin-off audio adventures of the Daleks and of the Daleks.Star whaleThe Star Whale is a giant whale like creature, presumed to be the last of its kind, used to pilot the Starship UK, so as to save its citizens from the dangerous solar flares. The whale has the features of other animals such as an anglerfishs angler, an octopus tentacles and a scorpions tail. It arrived on Earth as it heard the children of the United Kingdom crying, and was unable to bear the sound. Believing its arrival to be a one-in-a-million miracle, the people of Britain captured it and built their ship around it, torturing it in order to keep the ship flying. Over the years, they realised that they could not justify keeping the creature in agony, but feared that if they set it free, the ship and all those aboard would be destroyed, so they chose to forget, and fed those who protested to the beast. When the Doctor learnt of this, he decided to render the creature brain-dead, ending its suffering and saving the lives of all those on the ship, but Amy set it free, revealing that the whale had volunteered to help, and that contrary to the beliefs of the stations masters, that it would continue flying without the need to torture it.StigoraxSwampieSwarm (virus)SycoraxThe Sycorax first appeared in the debut Doctor story Christmas Invasion in 2005.The Sycorax appear to be skinless humanoids wearing mantles of bone, usually keeping their features concealed under helmets. They are proficient in the use of weapons like swords and whips, the latter which can deliver an energy discharge that disintegrates the flesh of its target. Their language is called Sycoraxic. The Sycorax also appear to have technology that is either disguised or treated as magic, referring to curses and the Doctors regenerative abilities as witchcraft. The Sycorax leader referred to an armada that they could use to take Earth by force if their blood control plan failed. They also appear to have a martial society, with traditions of honourable combat, yet they have no qualms about killing prisoners. According to the BBC website, the Sycorax facial structure was inspired by the skull of a horse.According to a write-up by T Davies on the BBC website, the Sycorax originated on an asteroid in the distant JX82 system, known as the Fire Trap. They were uplifted when a spaceship crashed on their asteroid and the Sycorax Leader enslaved the survivors, forcing the aliens to teach them about their technology. The asteroid was then retrofitted into the first of many spaceships, which the Sycorax then used to raid other planets, becoming feared interstellar scavengers. This reputation is made clear in their attitude to other inferior races. The Sycorax leader comments to Rose that he would not dirty his tongue with her language, and their translated word for human can also be taken to mean cattle. Their armada is permanently in orbit around the Jewel of Staa Crafell.In The Doctor Who Files books, the name of the Sycorax homeworld is given as Sycorax. It is unclear if this is another name for the Fire Trap. Furthermore, after the destruction of the Fire Trap, the Sycorax spread further through the galaxy, and like humans are one of three species that continually survive and adapt, even unto the End of the Universe.(Doctor Who Starships And Spacestations 2008)The name Sycorax is used in Shakespeares play Tempest. Shakespeares Sycorax has died before the play begins; she is described as a witch who was the mother of the beast Caliban. The Shakespearean name is referenced in the third series episode Shakespeare Code when the Doctor finds a horses skull in The Globes prop cupboard. He comments that it Reminds him too much of the Sycorax. Shakespeare remarks he likes the sound of the word, obviously then going on to use it in Tempest.The Sycorax also make a brief appearance in the Doctor episode Pandorica Opens as one of the races in the alliance formed to trap the Doctor.TTaran beastTenzaTerileptilThe Terileptils appeared in the Doctor serial The Visitation by Saward. They are a humanoid species, they cannot survive long without breathing soliton gas, which is highly combustible when combined with oxygen. As an advanced society, they enjoy a heightened appreciation of both aesthetics and warfare, and have been known to employ bejewelled androids. Criminal punishment in Terileptil society includes life imprisonment working in tinclavic mines on the planet Raaga, often with sub-standard medical care.In 1666, a group of Terileptil prison escapees hidden near London attempted to use a genetically enhanced version of the Plague to destroy humanity. The destruction of their lab in Pudding Lane, with help from the Doctor, causes the Fire of London.The Terileptils destroyed the Screwdriver which did not appear again until the Doctor Who TV Movie.According to the Missing Adventures novel The Dark Path by A. McIntee, by the 34th century, their homeworld Terileptus is a member of the Galactic Federation, and a noted builder of starships. A Terileptil also appears as the chief engineer on a Federation starship. The planet is destroyed during the events described in the novel.TerradonianTeselectaThe Teselecta, first shown in Kill Hitler, is a robot-like machine with the ability to change its appearance. It is commanded by humans, however smaller robots referred to as antibodies patrol its interior and incinerate intruders. The Teselecta are sent through time by an organization called The Justice Department with the intent to remove people from their established time stream to enforce punishment on them, though it does this only shortly before their end. This is regarded as a responsibility that comes with the capability of time travel. The Teselecta is not bigger on the inside, instead its crew are actually shrunk by means of a miniaturization ray and a compression field. They have access to numerous files on important people. In Lets Kill Hitler, Amy and Rory are trapped within a Teselecta and chased by its robotic immune system, the antibodies.(BBC - Doctor Who - Lets Kill Hitler - News & Features) Wrist-bands worn by the crew stop the robots attacking them, and anybody not wearing this band is incinerated. Later in the episode the crew of the Teselecta are evacuated by what appears to be a trans-mat-beam. The Teselecta reappears in the Series 6 Finale Wedding of River Song. The Doctor is supposed to be killed in Lake Silenco, Utah,  so he hides with his TARDIS inside the robot which takes his form, making it appear he is killed. To the extent of how much the Teselecta imitates a lifeform, it expelled light similiar to regeneration energy when faking the Doctor trying to save himself.TetrapThe Tetraps are a bat-like race from the planet Tetrapyriarbus. A pack of Tetraps was employed by the Rani to help defend her Giant Brain in the Doctors debut story, and the Rani (1987) by and Jane Baker. The Rani armed a pack of Tetraps for this purpose and used them as general henchmen to terrorise the native Lakertyans.Tetraps have four eyes, one on each side of their head, giving them all-round vision, and put this to good use in stalking fugitives. Like bats, they sleep by hanging upside-down in a cavern. They feed off a dark red-coloured sludge that the Lakertyan leader releases down a chute into a trough.Tetraps possess limited intelligence, but they soon realise that the Ranis plans would have them all killed on Lakertya. This is confirmed when their leader, Urak, hears of her plans and she later leaves him to guard over her laboratory rather than take him with her in her TARDIS, thus condemning him to death. Urak and the enraged Tetraps capture the Rani in her ship and take her back to their home planet, to force her to help solve their natural resource shortages.ThalTharilThe 456The 456 (pronounced four-five-six not four hundred and fifty-six) served as the main antagonists during the third series.They are unnamed aliens with whom the government of the United Kingdom made a deal in 1965; the 456 extorted twelve children in return for a cure to an Earth-bound virus which was about to mutate. They are only known by the frequency they are using, 456. When asked for their species name by John Frobisher, they chose to go by this name. They seem to require (or at least prefer) a highly toxic atmosphere, and to be non-humanoid of form, possessing three insect like heads which appear to spew green slime whenever the creatures are aggravated or pressured. In Children of Earth: Day Four, parts of the 456 were briefly seen when a government operative entered its chamber with a portable video camera. It had 3 heads, which possessed mandibles. The rest of the body is trunklike, like a giant caterpillar. A swelling is briefly shown at the end of the creature. After the 456 return to Earth over forty years later, an ambassador of the species demanded that 10% of the worlds children be given to the race as a gift, or else the entire human race would be destroyed. To ensure humanity would accept this deal, the 456 announced their arrival several days in advance by possessing and speaking through every pre-pubescent child on earth. A closer view of the visiting 456 specimen showed it had incorporated the bodies of human children into its own, the two being connected by four vine-like tentacles, because of an unnamed chemical pre-pubescents produce that the creatures use like a drug. According to the 456 themselves, such children feel no pain, and live long beyond their natural span. The children do not appear to have physically grown, although they are wizened perhaps mutated in some way and appear to be aware of their surroundings and their own condition; they breathe using respirators. The 456 are responsible for the death of Jones when they release a deadly virus into a building where Ianto was present. They are eventually defeated when Harkness manages to reverse the frequency of a previous transmission made by the 456 and turn it into a weapon against them, driving them away from Earth, although he is forced to sacrifice his grandson Steven to use him as the source of the frequency broadcast in the first place.The AbominationMentioned in Lisas Revenge, The Abomination is a fifteenth-century painting by Giuseppe Di Cattivo. The painting was considered too terrifying to be seen. The paint used contained a mineral that hosted an alien organism. Once in close proximity to the Lisa (painted with the same mineral paint), the Abomination and Mona Lisa came to life. The painting of the Abomination was stored in a vault that required a complex puzzle key to open it. When Mona Lisa came to life, she sought the key to release the Abomination.The BerserkerThe Berserkers were a cult of aliens that used pendants that give the wearer psychic powers, so that others are compelled to obey them. In the episode Mark of the Berserker, one such pendant was found at Park Vale School, by a boy, Jacob. He used the pendant but discarded it, fearing its power and the mysterious tattoos it produces on the wearer. Rani picked it up, and then put it in Sarah Janes attic. When Clyde invited his estranged father, Paul Langer, to see the alien artefacts stored in the attic, his father stole the pendant. He used it to make Clyde forget about his mother and friends, calling Clyde his soldier. Clydes father was possessed until Clyde threw the pendant into the sea and destroyed its power.The DarkAllies of The Blue Beast, Pwccm, The Dark are beings made of pure darkness that feature in the novel Twilight Streets. Normally these beings would have been defeated and sent back to the Rift by Abaddon, but Jacks defeat of Abaddon allowed the Dark free rein. As the team investigated the situation, the Dark showed them glimpses of an alternate future where the Dark corrupted Toshiko, Owen and Gwen, driving them to capture Jack and use his immortality as a means of controlling the Rift, thus gaining access to advanced technology and turning Torchwood into a world-spanning empire. It is only thanks to Iantos sacrifice that Jack is able to draw the Dark out of his friends by engaging the Rift Manipulator, although he, Tosh and Owen die in the process. With the knowledge of this future driving them, the team are thus convinced to work with Bilis Manger by channelling the Dark into a box and subsequently sending them back into the Rift. Like all Torchwood spin-off media, its canonicity in relation to the television series remains open to interpretation.The DeadThe Dead are an alien species appearing in the episode Lost Souls, broadcast on Radio 4 to celebrate the switching on of the Hadron Collider. In the episode The Dead managed to enter our universe during a test run of the machine, and fed off the neutrons of the humans it came in contact with. It had psychic abilities to persuade humans that it was deceased friends of people it came in contact with, which it used on Dr Harrington and Ianto Jones. It was destroyed when Torchwood, working with Martha Jones and the staff at CERN, fired an anti-proton beam into the Large Hadron Collider.The E0*ty CH53DThe Family of BloodThe Family of Blood was an alien race that feasted on Lords to prolong their own lifespan and increase their powers. Shortly before World War I, a family of them came to Easton Boys School, where they took over peoples bodies in order to get to the Doctor. They used animated scarecrows for henchman and to find bodies for the family in order to take them over. When they located the Doctor (who had converted his biology from Time Lord to human, they sent an army of scarecrows to hunt him. The Doctor eventually resumed his Time Lord form and imprisoned all of the familys members.The FloodA nickname given by the Tenth Doctor to the aquatic infection found in the water found in Mars ice caps. When the Flood infect a human, the hosts irises fade to white, his teeth blacken and cracks form all around his mouth. The resulting zombie-like creature then seeks to infect everyone around it with the water that they can shoot from any part of their body. The Mars base Bowie Base One fell under the Flood.The Headless MonksUnknown which planet these creatures come from. They wear cloaks with hoods draped over their necks to give an impression that they once had a head. Then the hood is removed it is seen that the skin has been tied into a tight knot where the head has been cut away.The LightAllies of the Grey Beast, Abaddon, The Light are beings made of pure halogen that feature in the novel Twilight Streets. The headless monks were also known for recently being spotted at the London riots.The SanctifiedThe Sanctified() are a race of bipedal aliens who appear in the serialised Magazine comic Rift War. They exhibit a crimson mane and no facial flesh - just muscles and tendons. Their primary objective upon Earth is to stop Torchwood from using the Rift to destroy the Sanctified - an event which is yet to occur.The SilenceThe SwarmAlso know by the Unified Intelligence Task-Force (U.N.I.T) as Stingrays, they are flying ray-like creatures, with metal exoskeletons that allow them to travel from planet to planet via wormholes. They consume everything on a planet, turning it into desert; and then swarm over the planets surface, generating a wormhole which allows them to travel to the next planet.The Stingrays are apparently arthropods, as they are exothermic, and possess an exoskeleton composed of metal that has been ingested then exuded to the exoskeleton. They are voracious feeders, eating both organic and inorganic materials ranging from flesh and bone to plant matter to metals and plastic. They also produce vast numbers of young and grow from birth to adult in under a year, as shown when the doctor shows a year-old clip of San Helios before its Stingray infestation.They travel to other planets through wormholes created in the fabric of Spacetime by circling a planet faster and faster, and as each swarm can contain billions of giant stingrays, they rip a hole in space. Their wormholes can transport the whole swarm an infinite distance through space.The Tricksters BrigadeThe Tricksters Brigade serve the recurring Sarah Jane Adventures villain, The Trickster. They, which takes shape of many lifeforms such as a beetle, also feed on chaos in time as the Trickster does. In Turn Left, a Time Beetle, a member of The Tricksters Brigade, attaches itself onto the back of companion Noble, altering time to where she never met the Doctor in The Runaway Bride, leading to his death. This causes the deaths of to-be-companion Jones as well as The Sarah Jane Adventures characters Jane Smith, Luke Smith, Jackson, and Langer (and Jones) who attempted to restore the Royal Hope Hospital back to its location and halt the plans of the Judoon. London is destroyed after the fall of the Titanic (Voyage of the Damned) and no help is offered from America due to the Adipose crisis (Partners in Crime). Torchwood Three sacrifices themselves to save planet Earth from the Sontarans (Poison Sky) to keep the air unpoisoned. Donna is able to foil the brigades plans before reality is destroyed by Davros.In the Torchwood episode Sins, Harkness and Angelo Colasanto discovers that The Tricksters Brigade plans to cause the victory of Germany by assassinating Delano Roosevelt by use of a brain parasite.The TricksterThe Trickster is a being beyond the universe which seeks to manifest itself through causing chaos. It can interfere in deaths, by making deceptive deals to prolong life at a price. It can only exist within the universe for brief periods, without physical form, sometimes in a mirror or other reflective surface. It is a member of the Pantheon of Discord. Played by Marc Davis, the Trickster is a recurring nemesis in The Sarah Jane Adventures. Though the character does not directly appear in the series related programmes (parent show Doctor Who and adult sister show Torchwood), the Tricksters attempts to change history have nevertheless been depicted.In Happened to Sarah Jane?, in order to create chaos of sufficient magnitude, the Trickster removed Sarah Jane from history so that an asteroid that only she could have stopped would hit the Earth. The Trickster altered an incident in Sarah Janes childhood in 1964 that originally led to the death of her best friend Andrea. The Trickster switched the places of the two girls after gaining Andreas consent, creating a timeline in which Sarah Jane died at age 13. Preferring a meaningless destruction of Earth rather than for profit or military conquest, the Trickster also influenced the various alien threats Sarah Jane had faced on Earth to stay away from the planet, creating a peaceful timeline up until the impending asteroid strike. Keeping Sarah Jane in Limbo, it further planned to use her to find and remove the Doctor from history, which would create a timeline of diabolical chaos, wherein the many tragedies the Doctor averted would have instead proceeded.The Time Beetle that consumed time energy by changing an individuals personal timeline in the Doctor Who episode Turn Left was described as part of the Tricksters Brigade. Its alteration of Nobles history led to the Doctors death, resulting in a timeline similar to that planned by the Trickster. The alternate timeline included the off-camera deaths of Sarah Jane, Luke, Clyde, Rani and Maria - as well as the Doctors would-be companion, Jones - in the events otherwise depicted in Smith and Jones.In Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith, the Trickster returned with the Graske. It manifested in 1951 after Sarah Jane saved her parents lives. By 2008 it had completely devastated the planet and enslaved the human population, and was working on conquering other planets. Sarah Jane returned to the point of his manifestation in an attempt to stop him, but could not think of a suitable method. Her parents willingly drive off in their car, leading to their death, causing the Trickster to vanish and the original time to be restored. The Trickster materialised through the Abbotts Gate at the old monastery in Sarah Janes home village of Foxgrove. This entry point was razed for the construction of an A road in 1964.(Mr Smith states the history of Foxgrove to Sarah Jane at her request in Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith)The Trickster returned in Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith, having made a deal with lawyer Peter Dalton after an accident at home, granting Dalton his life and the love he never had, Sarah Jane Smith. Sarah Jane fell in love with Dalton, and agreed to marry him, but the wedding was interrupted by the arrival of the Doctor. The Trickster took the hotel out of time, trapping Sarah Jane and Peter in one second while the Doctor, K9, Luke, Clyde and Rani were trapped in another. Realising that the Trickster intended for Sarahs marriage to end her life of defending the Earth, Sarah Jane convinced Peter that he must break the deal, sacrificing himself so that Sarah Jane could continue to save the world. The Trickster made reference to the Tenth Doctors future regeneration and added that the Doctors first meeting with the Pantheon of Discord had sent ripples back through time. The Trickster was revealed to be vulnerable to artron energy, the power source of the TARDIS; Clyde became charged with artron energy when he came in contact with the TARDIS while it was attempting to penetrate the Tricksters time rift. He was able to use the energy to harm the Trickster, draining its energy long enough for the Doctor to penetrate the Tricksters temporal trap.The Trickster is briefly referenced in the Miracle Day episode Sins. In the episode, Captain Jack Harkness and his boyfriend/companion Angelo intercept and destroy an alien parasite that the Tricksters brigade had planned to use to infect Delano Roosevelt and create an alternate timeline where Germany won War Two.TigellanTime BeetleThe Time Beetle(In the Who Confidential episode accompanying Turn Left, T Davies stated that the production team refer to it as the Time Beetle.) is a member of the Tricksters Brigade, a group of aliens that serve the Trickster. The Time Beetle, similar to the Trickster himself, feeds on time energy and can cause a victim to change a decision they made in the past, thereby altering history. The change in history is usually very minor, affecting only the person the beetle attaches to, and the universe usually compensates for the discrepancy.When the beetle attaches to Donna in Turn Left, it prevents her from ever meeting the Doctor, resulting in disaster for Earth. The Doctor, Martha Jones, Sarah Jane Smith, and Torchwood staff Jones and Cooper were all killed, the city of London was completely destroyed when the Titanic crashed into Buckingham Palace, Captain Harkness was taken to the Sontaran homeworld, and millions of people died from threats the Doctor would have otherwise prevented. If the alternative future had continued, reality would have been destroyed by Davros.In an accompanying Monster Files episode, Captain Jack raised doubts over whether the whole of the Tricksters Brigade consists of beetles, suggesting all individuals are of different species.In the Torchwood episode Sins, the Tricksters Brigade is mentioned as they attempt to cause the victory of Germany by assassinating Delano Roosevelt through a parasite.Time LordThe Doctor, a Time Lord who can cheat death by repairing his body into a new person, used to travel with Sarah Jane during his third and fourth incarnations. In his tenth incarnation, he meets Sarah Jane again in the Doctor Who episode School Reunion (prior to of the Bane), where along with a new model of K-9 he gives Sarah Jane multiple sonic lipsticks as well as a wristwatch that detects alien life. In Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith, he helps her escape from the Trickster during her wedding. He later returns in his eleventh regeneration in of the Doctor where he joins Sarah Jane and Jo Jones to foil a plan by the Shansheeth who want to steal his TARDIS.ToclafaneThe Toclafane(Their name has been quoted by Doctor Who Fact Files on the BBCs website as meaning roughly Fool the fan, in French. It has actually no meaning in that language.) are the last remnants of humanity from the year 100 trillion. Originally intending to travel to Utopia, the last refuge of a dying universe, they find nothing but the dark and the cold of space. Losing the last shred of hope they had, they turned on themselves, cannibalising their own bodies to create a new cyborg race. As part of this process they regress into little more than children with shared memories. The name Toclafane is given to them by the Master, who takes it from the Gallifreyan equivalent of the bogeyman.The Toclafanes cyborg forms possess energy devices capable of killing and disintegrating targets. They are equipped with numerous retractable blades. The first four to be seen also exhibit apparent teleportation or cloaking abilities, not displayed by others of their race. All that remains of their bodies are barely recognisable human faces wired into basketball-sized mechanical spheres.In Sound of Drums/of the Time Lords, the Master rescues four Toclafane from the end of the universe prior to an eventual Freeze, using them to fake a first contact situation in order to draw the worlds leaders into one place for easy capture. He then uses a paradox machine to allow the future of the human race to slaughter many in the present, in short bringing the six billion humans that are alive in the year 100 trillion to return in the form of the Toclafane. The paradox machine creates a temporal paradox, allowing them to kill their ancestors without damaging themselves, and thus establish the Masters rule over Earth. After subduing Earth, the Master aims to establish a new Lord empire with himself as the leader and the Toclafane as his people and ground troops. This plan is foiled when the paradox machine is destroyed, causing time to rewind and trapping the Toclafane back at the end of the universe.The Toclafane feature on the cover of the Series Adventures novel, Story of Martha, which chronicles Marthas adventures during The Year That Never Was.TorajiiA sentient star featured in the episode 42. The crew of a cargo ship uses a scoop on Torajii to refuel their ship, unaware that it is actually a living creature. Torajii then uses the stolen particles to possess crewmembers and kill them.TractatorTrakeniteTravist PolongTravist Polong is an orange, metre-long, five-eyed slug/slater-like alien. Sarah Jane attempted to catch it at a hospital at Tarminster in Mark of the Berserker, but left to deal with a Berserker.Travist Polong was later delivered to Sarah Jane in Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith after she saw it on eBay in its dormant stage. Rani and Clyde took it inside Ranis house, but it escaped. They chased it to 13 Bannerman Road, where they caught it in a garbage can. Sarah Jane directed Rani to order Mr Smith to teleport it to Polongus, its home planet. Sarah Jane described Travist Polong as not evil, just trouble.TrionTritovoreHumanoid fly creatures, they trade with other civilisations for their excrement. They communicate with clicks that the TARDIS didnt translate because it was not on the same planet as The Doctor and Lady Christina de Souza. The Doctor speaks with them through their own language while they understand The Doctor through a one-way telepathic translating communication device.TythonianUUrbankanUsurianThe Usurians from the planet Usurius are a species that abandoned military conquest in favour of economic conquest. They enslaved humanity after their engineers made Mars suitable for human habitation, humans having depleted the Earths resources. Once humanity had depleted Marss resources as well, the Usurians engineered Pluto so that humans could inhabit it. They created six artificial Suns around it and installed the Collector to oversee the collection of taxes from their human workforce. They intended to abandon Pluto and leave humanity to become extinct once the humans had exhausted its resources, there being no economically viable planet to relocate humanity to once more. The humans on Pluto revolted against the Collector and seized control of Pluto. The revolutionaries intended to relocate to Earth as the Doctor assured them it would have regenerated in their absence.The Usurians have knowledge of the Lords, graded as Grade 3 in their latest market survey, considering Gallifrey to be of low commercial value. Usurians can adopt a humanoid form but in their natural state they resemble seaweed. Shock can force them to revert to their natural form. According to the Doctor, Usurians are listed in a flora and fauna of the universe written by a Professor Thripthead under poisonous fungi.UvodniThe Uvodni is a bug-like race, first introduced in of Kudlak. General Kudlak served in his races military until injuries forced him to retire. In order to gain more troops for his races continuing war effort, Kudlak was dispatched to Earth. He seized control of the Combat 3000 laser game franchise, which he secretly used to find human children with strong combat skills. These children were teleported to Kudlaks orbiting spaceship and dispatched to fight in his races war. Kudlak took orders from a battle computer that used the image of a female of his race as an avatar, which he referred to as Mistress. An error left the computer unable to comprehend the concept of the war ending, so it withheld from Kudlak an announcement of peace from his emperor for over a decade. When this fact was revealed, by intervention of Luke Smiths computer hacking, Kudlak destroyed the computer. He then dedicated his life to finding and returning the already dispatched human children, hoping to gain inner peace by doing so.VValidiumVampireA number of different types of vampire have appeared in televised Doctor Who:* In the fourth episode of the 1965 Doctor serial The Chase, the Doctor, Chesterton, Barbara Wright and Vicki encounter Dracula and Monster, who make short work of a pursuing party of Daleks. The Doctor speculates that the monsters and the haunted mansion that they inhabit are the products of nightmares created from the human psyche. As the TARDIS and the Daleks time capsule leave, it is revealed that the monsters are in fact funfair robots.* The Doctor encounters vampires whilst travelling in E-Space in the 1980 serial of Decay. The Doctor, Romana, Adric and K-9 encounter three vampires, Aukon, Camilla and Zargo. It is revealed that the three are servants of the giant King Vampire, a member of the Great Vampires who once fought a great war against the Lords but were eventually defeated. By escaping to E-Space, the King Vampire was the sole surviving member of its race. The Doctor defeats the King Vampire by launching the lesser vampires tower  actually the command module of the ship piloted by the originally human trio  and using it as a stake to pierce the giant vampires heart. The three servant vampires perish along with their king.* The Doctor, Williams and Pond encountered vampiric, lobster-like aliens in 16th century Venice in Vampires of Venice. They were able to breathe underwater and had vampire-like qualities such as a vulnerability to sunlight, no reflections and a thirst for blood. Their leader, Signora Rosanna Calvierri, has a perception filter that allows herself and her family to take humanoid forms, except for her brood which lived under the river. They planned to flood Venice in an attempt to continue their civilisation since their own planet Saturnyne was destroyed by cracks. When the Doctor foiled their plan, Rosanna committed suicide by allowing her brood to devour her.Vampires have also appeared in Doctor Who stories in other media. Vampires related to the Great Vampires seen in State of Decay are featured prominently in the Virgin New Adventures novel Harvest, the Missing Adventure Opera, the BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures novel Science, and the Big Finish Productions audio dramas Twilight and Lazarus. The Eighth Doctor Adventure Eight Doctors also features them in a flashback to State of Decay; in addition, the war between the vampires and the Time Lords is a significant plot element in the New Adventure Damaged Goods. Other vampires or vampire-like creatures have been featured in the Missing Adventure Managra, the audio drama Snake Head, the BBCi webcast Comes to Time, the short story The Feast of the Stone (featuring an alternate Ninth Doctor), the Summerfield anthology Vampire Curse, and the Torchwood website.VanirVardanVarga plantThe Varga plants (sometimes Vaarga) appeared in the Doctor episode to the Unknown and the serial Daleks Master Plan, which were essentially a prologue and main epic respectively. They were created by Nation.Varga Plants grew naturally on the Daleks homeworld, Skaro, and when the Daleks set up a base on the planet Kembel they brought some Varga plants with them to act as sentries in the jungle surrounding their base. They were suited to this as they could move around freely by dragging themselves along with their roots.Varga plants resemble cacti; they are covered in fur and thorns. Anyone pricked by a Varga thorn will be consumed by the urge to kill, while simultaneously becoming a Varga plant themself. This grisly fate befell astronauts Jeff Garvey and Gordon Lowery, and their commander, Marc Cory, was forced to kill them.The plants later made an appearance in the Big Finish audio Davros: Purity. In this, it was revealed that the Varga plants were one of the oldest species on Skaro, but for most of their history had been immobile. Since the start of the Kaled-Thal war however, exposure to radiation and chemical weapons had caused them to rapidly evolve into a much deadlier form, capable of self-locomotion. It was this discovery that caused Davros to become interested in genetically engineering creatures in order to create weapons of war. In Dalek Empire II: Dalek War, they were found on a terraformed Jupiter where they infected earth troops. They appeared in City of the Daleks where after the Time War they infested the ruined Dalek city of Kaalann on Skaro but here their appearance was much different.VarosianVashta NeradaVashta Nerada (literally: the shadows that melt the flesh) are microscopic swarm creatures which, when present in a high enough concentration, are totally indistinguishable from shadows, and use this to their advantage in approaching and attacking prey. They are described as the piranhas of the air, able to strip their victims to the bone in an instant in high enough densities. The Doctor says that almost every planet in the universe has some, including Earth, and claims that they can be seen as the specks of dust visible in unusually bright light. On most planets, however, Vashta Nerada exist in relatively low concentrations, feeding primarily on carrion, with attacks on people being comparatively rare. In the episode in the Library, an unusually high concentration of Vashta Nerada had completely overrun the 51st century Library, resulting in the apparent death of everyone inside at the time.Vashta Nerada normally live in forested areas, and reproduce by means of microscopic spores which can lay dormant in wood pulp. In the episode of the Dead, this is revealed to be the reason for their unusual prevalence in The Library, as it is made known that the books and The Library itself were constructed of wood from the Vashta Neradas native forest feeding grounds. Individually, Vashta Nerada are non-sapient, but if a large enough concentration come together, they can form a group mind of human-level intelligence capable of communication.The fourth episode of Who: The Adventure Games, Shadows of the Vashta Nerada, features them as the leading villain.VeilVeils are able to step into the bodies of others, controlling them. They can also induce a trance by touching their victims. In the episode, of the Judoon, Androvax, the last Veil, was a fugitive responsible for destroying twelve planets, and was pursued by the Judoon after the Judoon prison ship containing him crashed on Earth. He then returned on the episode Vault of Secrets, seeking help from Sarah Jane, Clyde and Rani due to the fact that he was ill and wanted to return to his own kind. Androvax was successful in awakening the survivors of the Veils as he searches for a new world for them to reside in.Venom grubVenusianVenusians are inhabitants of the planet Venus, the closest planet to Earth. They had large feet, and six arms. The Doctor often employed a form of Venusian martial art (called Venusian aikido or Venusian karate) and sang Venusian lullabies (to the tune of Rest Ye, Merry Gentlemen). Venusian aikido is allegedly very hard for two-armed beings to learn. Its use appeared in the serials Inferno, of the Daleks, and others. The Doctor favored a more subtle version which involved applying a single finger, seen in Survival. The Doctor revealed to Davros in of the Daleks that a battle between the Venusians and the Daleks in the Space Year 17,000 was ended by the intervention of a group of battleships from the planet Hyperon. Although Venus today is utterly devoid of life, the Missing Adventures novel Lullaby shows Venus to have been inhabited billions of years ago, before the surface became too hot to support life.VervoidArtificially created plant-based humanoids who possess problem-solving intelligence and the power of speech; they were intended to perform tasks usually carried out by robots, but for a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately they instead decided to eradicate all of animalkind. Vervoids had about the size and strength of humans, but were covered in leaves which provided them with energy through photosynthesis. They possessed thorns so poisonous they could kill a human on contact, and could produce copious amounts of methane-based swamp gas.VespiformThe Vespiform are a insectoid species resembling giant wasps, born en masse in hives in the Silfrax Galaxy. Each possesses the ability to morph into other species. It also has the ability to breed with other species, including humans, to produce offspring. The Monster Files feature establishes them as an ancient race and that they have fought the Quarks.(BBC  Doctor Who  Videos  Series Four)Vespiform have a telepathic connection to objects called firestones, which contain part of their mind. Like Earths wasps, the Vespiform are vulnerable to water. A Vespiform-human hybrid can live a normal life as a human until a burst of intense emotion awakens its alien biology. They are said to be at war with the Quark rebels. When the Vespiform morphs into another species it emits a purple light.In Unicorn and the Wasp, when the Vespiform appears it goes on a killing spree (in the style of Agatha Christies murder mystery books) to keep anybody from revealing that it is actually the son of the rich Lady Eddison. The Vespiform attempts to kill the Doctor by poisoning his drink with cyanide. The drink was poisoned by Reverend Golightly, the human version of the Vespiform. In the end the Vespiform is killed by Donna Noble who drowns it in a lake.VinvocciThe Vinvocci are a race of spiky green aliens who first appeared in End of Time. A pair of Vinvocci came to Earth as part of a salvage operation to recover Vinvocci techonologya medical device for healing entire planets, which Joshua Naismith named the Immortality Gate. They possess disguise technology referred to by the Doctor as a Shimmer. When the Doctor notes a similarity to Bannakaffalatta from Voyage of the Damned, noting the distinction that he was small, and red, the Vinvocci are quick to differentiate themselves from the Zocci.ViperoxInsectoid creatures that attempted to destroy Earth in 1958, in the Dry Springs of Nevada.VirusViyransThe Viyrans are an elusive race of aliens heard in Finish Productions audio stories.They originate from a distant galaxy that waged a huge war using a wide variety of powerful technologically advanced weapons. A final peace agreement was reached and the biological weapons were gathered together at the Amethyst Viral Containment Station with the intention of destroying them. But then there was an incident involving the Doctor and the Daleks and all of the dangerous virus weaponry was spread throughout the universe, landing on various worlds and causing havoc.The Viyrans come from that distant galaxy. Their job is to seek out all the stray viruses, neutralise them and cure any victims, if possible. They also feel its their duty to make sure no one finds out anything about any of this, in case someone of low morals tries to track down some of these viruses themselves.They have no real spoken language, but communicate psychically or through hand motions or sometimes by trying to replicate an individuals voice. They can also time travel. What they actually look like is a mystery, but they are humanoid in shape, always appearing in a white type of suit. When they find an infected location, they block off the area and work in secret, never letting anyone know they were there, before, during or after. They collect all the victims in flying glass coffins and attempt to cure them. If the infected individuals can be cured, they are returned and their memories of the events are erased. If not, they are destroyed.The first appearance of The Viyrans was in a short story called No One Died from the 2007 Doctor Who Storybook, featuring the Doctor and Tyler. Their first appearance in an audio story was Mission of the Viyrans with the Doctor and Brown. The viral explosion is witnessed in Patient Zero. In Forgotten Planet it is revealed that Pollard is employed by the Viyrans after they cure a virus she contracted.Although they did not appear themselves, their engineered viruses were featured in Urgent Calls, Urban Myths and Wishing Beast & The Vanity Box. These one part stories (and Mission of the Viyrans) were listed in their booklets as being part of the Virus Strand arc. Some of the viruses theyve tried to neutralise include a virus that can destroy the minds of an entire planet (No One Died), a particle that can induce beneficial coincidences for communications devices (Urgent Calls), an exaggerating frenzy illness (Urban Myths), a living wish-granting device (The Wishing Beast & The Vanity Box) and a rapidly spreading contagion that crudely distorts DNA, slowly killing its victims (Mission of the Viyrans).VoganVondraxA race known as the Vondrax appear in the novel Trace Memory by David Llewellyn. According to Jack Harkness, the Vondrax are said to be one of the oldest sentient lifeforms in the universe, and feed on tachyon radiation. They are capable of time travel, and frequently change shape. In Trace Memory they adopt a humanoid form, wearing suits and bowler hats, and carrying umbrellas. The character of Torchwood agent Valentine says that in Japan they (the Vondrax) were said to resemble Samurai. In Egypt they came like gods. The Vondrax are able to kill their victims by simply looking at them, a technique that only fails to work on Jack, and in fact seems to have the reverse effect, killing the Vondrax itself.VoordVortisaurVortisaurs are fictional creatures from the Doctor series of Who audio plays by Big Finish. Much like the Reapers of the TV series, Vortisaurs are a species of time-sensitive flying reptiles with cosmetic similarities to pterosaurs. They live exclusively in the space-time vortex, the dimension which time machines like the Doctors TARDIS pass through as they travel from point to point. Vortisaurs are drawn to the chronal distortions radiated by objects traversing the vortex, and occasionally scavenge from ships wrecked and lost in that environment. Their jaws are fixed with sharp teeth; on biting, beyond the physical wound, the chronal energies of the creature age the wound and the surrounding tissue by decades. The Doctor appears to have extensive training in the handling of Vortisaurs, referring to them as bloodhounds and showing a proficiency for handling of the beasts. On at least two occasions he offers anecdotes of his days as a youth, riding Vortisaurs bareback.In Storm Warning, the Doctor encounters a flock of Vortisaurs scavenging from the hulk of a time ship; his efforts to drive them off, only result in his being attacked himself. Although he manages to retreat to 1930 France, materialising his TARDIS on board the Airship R101, he unknowingly tows one of the creatures along with him, a fact revealed when it begins to attack the airship crew. The Doctor and his new companion Charley use the Vortisaur as a ride to escape the crash of the airship. Charley takes a liking to the Vortisaur, naming it Ramsay after the then-Prime Minister James Ramsay MacDonald. After a few serials of failed domestication attempts, Ramsay is eventually released back into the vortex.Later seasons of Eighth Doctor stories also include Vortisuars. No More Lies features bridled Vortisaurs ridden by marauding time warriors; again showing his affinity for the species, the Doctor at one point mounts one of these Vortisaurs, quickly giving it the name Margaret. In The Book of Kells, the Doctor discovers that a Vortisaur has been pulled out of the space-time vortex like his own TARDIS, and turned into vellum by a group of monks. It is described as being indigo with stripes.WWater hagA bio-organic race known only as water hags which grow their babies in mens throats because they need testosterone. They appear in the novel in the Water.WaterhiveThe Waterhive is the description given to an unnamed alien race from the New Series Adventures novel Feast of the Drowned. They are composed of water and can take over the body of a drowned being. The body is thus preserved, although the eyes of their host will become pearly, forcing glasses to be worn. They infiltrated the high ranks of the Navy in order to send sailors and their loved ones to their watery graves. Their plan was to use the living drowned as human incubators for their larvae, this failed when the Doctor reduced the hive to atoms.Weeping AngelsWeevilWerewolfWirrnThe Wirrn are an insectoid race that made their debut in the 1975 Doctor story Ark in Space. The name is sometimes spelled Wirrrn, which is a spelling originating from the novelisation of the story.The Wirrn claim to have originated from Andromeda (whether they meant the galaxy, the constellation, or even a planet named Andromeda is unclear), but were driven into space by human settlers. They are slightly larger than humans, dark green and wasp-like in appearance, and live mostly in space, although their breeding colonies are terrestrial. Their bodies are a self-contained system, their lungs being able to recycle waste dioxide and only needing to touch down occasionally on planetary bodies for food and oxygen. The Wirrns life cycle involves laying their eggs in living hosts; the larvae emerge to consume the host, absorbing its memories and knowledge. A Wirrn larva is a green slug-like creature, varying in size from a few inches to 1 or 2 metres across. It can infect another organism through contact with a substance it excretes, mutating them into an adult Wirrn and connecting their consciousness to the hive mind.In The Ark in Space, the Wirrn found Space Station Nerva in orbit around an Earth devastated centuries before by solar flares. The survivors had lain in animation waiting for the planet to recover, but had overslept by several millennia. The Wirrn intended to use the sleepers as a food source and claim the empty Earth for their own, as both a means of survival and an act of revenge against the human race for taking their former territories. In the course of their plan, Noah, leader of Nerva, was infected and converted to their kind. However, Noah still retained more than a vestige of human spirit, probably thanks to the encouragements of the Doctor, and led the Wirrn into Nervas transport ship even though he knew it was rigged to explode. It did so, ending the Wirrn threat.The Wirrn have also appeared in the Doctor Adventures novel Placebo Effect by Russell, and in the audio play Wirrn: Race Memory, produced by BBV. Big Finish used them in the audio stories Dawn with the Eighth Doctor and Isle with the Sixth. A dead Wirrn appears briefly in television story Stones of Blood.XXeraphinThe Xeraphin were an ancient species encountered by the Doctor in the story Time-Flight by Grimwade. Originating from the planet Xeriphas, they possessed immense psychokinetic and scientific powers. The Doctor believed the race to have been wiped out during the crossfire during the Vardon/Kosnax war. Instead, the entire race fled to Earth in an escaping spacecraft. The ship crashed near present day Heathrow some 140 million years ago. When the Xeraphin emerged they built a Citadel to mark their new home but the Xeraphin were so plagued with radiation that they abandoned their original humanoid bodies and transformed into a single bioplasmic gestalt intelligence within a sarcophagus at the heart of the Citadel.The arrival of the Master coincided with their emergence from the gestalt state when the radiation effects had subsided, and his influence caused the emergence of a split personality of good and evil, each side competing for their tremendous power while yearning to become a proper species once again. The Master, who was stranded on Earth at the time too, succeeded in capturing the Xeraphin as a new power source for his TARDIS. However, the Doctors intervention meant his nemesis TARDIS was sent to Xeriphas where events became out of his control.Before fleeing Xeriphas and the Xeraphin, the Master took with him Kamelion, a Xeraphin war weapon with advanced shape-changing abilities dependent on the will of its controller. Kamelion was freed from the Master and joined the Doctors TARDIS crew in Kings Demons.XeronXylokFile:Xylok.jpg|thumb|Jane Smith carefully holds a Xylok life form.Xyloks are a crystalline race that crashed into Earth as a meteorite about 60 million years ago. Consequently, the Xyloks that survived the crash were trapped beneath the surface of the Earth, regrowing over thousands of millennia.After the eruption of mount Krakatoa in 1883, one of the Xyloks was found in the post-volcanic aftermath. It was eventually passed to Jane Smith by a geologist friend when she was researching volcanic activity, 18 months prior to the events of The Lost Boy. During her studies of the crystalline structure, she found that it could use her laptop to communicate. The Xylok agreed to help Sarah Jane protect Earth, and was integrated into the supercomputer Mr Smith, built by Sarah Jane under the instruction of the Xylok. Unbeknownst to Sarah Jane, this was a ploy, in anticipation that it would one day be able to release the imprisoned Xylok race. Sarah Jane and her companions were able to thwart its intentions; as a result, Mr Smith was reprogrammed and became a benefit to the human race once again.YZZarbiThe Zarbi appeared in the 1965 Doctor story Web Planet written by Strutton, and are an ant-like insectoid species, with some characteristics associated with beetles, from the planet Vortis, which were controlled by the power of the Animus. They are roughly eight feet long, and the Menoptra claim that they are little more than cattle.They possess little intelligence but were not at all aggressive until the Animus arrived. They were enslaved to the alien consciousness and considered the butterfly-like Menoptra their mortal enemies. Only they could control the woodlouse-like venom grubs, also known as larvae guns.They returned to their normal ways after the Animus was defeated by the Doctor, Chesterton, Barbara Wright and Vicki. It is presumed that the various species on Vortis are now living peacefully together.ZocciThe Zocci are a race of red diminutive spiked aliens. Voyage of the Damned featured a Zocci named Bannakaffalatta. His species was first named in End of Time, where the Vinvocci are quick to differentiate themselves from the Zocci.Zolfa-ThuranZygonSee also* List of Doctor Who villains* List of Doctor Who henchmen* List of Doctor Who robotsReferencesExternal links* The Bumper Book of Doctor Who Monsters, Villains & Alien Species* Children of the Earth BBC Torchwood sitedes races non-humaines de la srie Doctor Who    "

His parents separated while he was still a young boy, his mother single-handily raised him, although his father still visited the family regularly. He has eight other siblings.He was fascinated with business at a very young age, as a child he sold indigenous food after school to contribute to the household income while his mother worked as a domestic worker. As with every business money is the key and the main objective, what he did was: whenever he got send he uses the change to buy sweets and resells the sweets at school to get more money and increase cash-flow.At the age of nine, he started cleaning yards and got paid on a weekly basis. This was a great incentive for him but later he realized that, the money coming in weekly, was not enough to buy enough stock to satisfy the demand for the product (sweets) at school. He arranged to receive the money month-end, this improve the cash-flow and the stock levels as well. As the cash-flow improved he bought a bicycle to extend his operations. The bicycle took him three years to pay-off.His first shop was a cardboard-box-shop in front of his mothers house in the black township, called the Location.EducationAs he grew up and finished secondary education, he opted to receive his tertiary education at the Technical Institute of Mining (NITM) in Arandis.

"33184400","Slz Valley Railway","|}The Slz Valley Railway () is a formerly 45 km long, partly disused railway line from Mlheim via Gladbach, Bensberg, Rsrath, Hoffnungsthal and Immekeppel to Lindlar in the German state of Rhine-Westphalia.S-Bahn services operate on the section between Cologne and Bergisch Gladbach, which is electrified. The remaining section was never electrified and is now largely closed, athough some of it is used for freight. The section between Rsrath and Hoffnungsthal is now part of the railway. History Cologne-MlheimBergisch GladbachBensberg section The initial plans of 1863 were to build a line from Mlheim am Rhine (now station) to Bergisch Gladbach and on to Wipperfrth. However, on 1 December 1868 the initial section was completed by the Railway Company to Bergisch Gladbach only.In 1870, the track was extended to Bensberg. This section was built as a double-track line. Trains continuing from Bergisch Gladbach needed to reverse in Gladbach station.In 1912, a connecting curve was built in Bergisch Gladbach before the terminal station. A second station was built in Bergisch Gladbach as a through station. The second station was only used for passengers and passenger trains ran to it directly by the new curve. Freight trains ran to the terminal station, where there were several sidings connecting to surrounding factories. The Zanders paper mill was and still is connected to the curve from the freight yard to Bensberg, and not directly to the freight yard.Since the opening of the new terminal station in central Bergisch Gladbach in the early 1950s, passenger trains have run there. For this reason, the connecting curve is no longer used and it was dismantled in the early 1960s. Nevertheless, there have been plans for some time to restore it so that container trains from the zinc works container terminal can avoid reversing in the old freight yard.The terminal station in Bergisch Gladbach has only been used as a passenger station prior to 1912 and since September 1965. Between 1912 and 1950 it was operated exclusively as a freight yard. With the construction of the new station building in 1950, passenger trains ran again in the railway terminus, so that until 1965, two passenger stations existed: Bergisch Gladbach Stadtmitte (city centre) at the site of the old terminus station with the newly built station building and Bergisch Gladbach station, south of the railway triangle. The passenger service between Bergisch Gladbach and Bensberg was closed on 29 September 1965, which was also the end of operation to the southern station. Freight traffic between Bergisch Gladbach and Bensberg ended on 27 May 1989.In 1974-75, the Slz Valley Railway was electrified for the Rhine-Sieg S-Bahn (now part of the S-Bahn), but not all tracks in Bergisch Gladbach station were electrified. In addition, the second track was restored between Kln-Mlheim and Kln-Dellbrck; the second track had been removed between Mlheim and Bergisch Gladbach in 1945.	In 2008, a new protected level crossing was built on the freight track at the roundabout next to the station. BensbergImmekeppel section In particular, the Gebrder Reusch company in Hoffnungsthal, then a sheet  metal manufacturer, and the Altenberg company (formally, the Rhein-Preuische Zink-, Gruben- und Htten-Gesellschaft St. Paul de Sincay & Companie), which among other things  operated a mine at Lderich near Hoffnungsthal, were very interested in links with the rail network.The line from Bensberg via Forsbach and Rsrath to Hoffnungsthal was opened in 1890. The line from Hoffnungsthal to Immekeppel was opened in 1891. This was a single-track line.Initial attempts to establish a line through the Slz Valley in 1873 failed, as the ministry rejected the new route. In 1883, a narrow gauge (gauge) railway was planned from Kalk via Rath, Rsrath and Volberg to Immekeppel. The project ultimately failed because the Prussian Ministry of Public Works refused to provide the estimated funding required amounting to 830,000 marks.In 1937, a secret three kilometre branch line was built from near Bensberg station for the transport of ammunition to Ostheim air base.() ImmekeppelLindlar section The continuation of the line to Lindlar was mainly built to connect with the Lindlar quarry and mining operations, since their freight at that time had to be taken to Engelskirchen stations or Kaiserau on the narrow-gauge Valley Railway.In 1897, the council of the Lindlar municipality formed a committee that dealt with the proposed railway, but all attempts to establish a railway failed at first. It was not until 1906 that a standard gauge railway from Immekeppel to Lindlar was approved by the government, so that construction of the line started in 1909 and it was opened in 1912. The plan provided for four stations: Obersteeg, Tscher, Linde and Lindlar. There was controversy over the naming of Tscher station. Finally in 1911 the name was changed to Hommerich. The ImmekeppelHommerich section was opened to traffic in January 1912 and the line from Hommerich to Lindlar was officially opened on 9 December 1912.Before the World War, an extension of the line was planned via Hartegasse, Frielingsdorf and Dohrgauler to Wipperfrth. This plan was never carried because of the outbreak of the war. Finally in 1927 the plan of the LindlarWipperfrth line was dropped in favour of a direct line from Bergisch Gladbach to Wipperfurth. But this line was also never built. Therefore, Lindlar station remained a sack station, which became less important and ultimately contributed to the closure of the line.By the late 1950s, a bus line was established along the railway. In 1960, the last passenger train ran between Hoffnungsthal and Lindlar, freight traffic and continued until 1966. In the same year the section was dismantled.Operations The line from Cologne-Mlheim to Bergisch Gladbach is operated on working days at 20-minute intervals and on weekends at 30-minute intervals as S-Bahn line S 11, using modern class 423 electric multiple units.Since the closure of the section of the Slz Valley Railway between Bergisch Gladbach and Lindlar, the section between Rsrath and Hoffnungsthal has operated as part of the Agger Valley Railway and is served by Bahn trains at 30 minute intervals.The line from Bergisch Gladbach station towards Bensberg to the zinc smelter is still open and on weekdays trains operate to the container terminal of und Gterverkehr Kln (Cologne port and rail freight) on Senefelderstrae.Notes References* *  External links * * * de:SlztalbahnKln-Mlheim - Lindlar"

They traditionally render protection to a variety of flora and fauna. Copardem, three kilometres from Valpoi, is a village famed for the sacred grove tradition known locally as Devachi rai, a tradition of community conservation carried out in the name of the local deity. Formerly spread across  of government land, much of the sacred grove is now encroached upon for cashew plantations and agriculture. The sacred grove is an excellent example of the old tradition of uneducated villagers protecting their environment.()Among its variety of flora are towering trees such as shidam (nudiflora) which support various other life forms in the grove. Creepers like garkani (Entada scandens) with their sword-like pods are found on the shidam, while the tree also houses beehives. The grove also has an evergreen species of Ashoka which bears unique saffron-coloured flowers. Pandanus furcatus known locally known as kegadi attracts village women when it bears flowers covered in yellow and soft thickets. During the monsoon, bioluminescent fungus which glitter at night grow on dead wood. The grove is also conducive for the growth of a variety of edible mushrooms such as alami, khutyali, sonyali and shringar.(In addition to mammals such as the deer, deer and deer, the tall trees attract birds including the serpent eagle, grey hornbill and hornbill.(Eleven kilometres from Valpoi town is Nanoda village that has an ancient tradition of nature worship. It is etymologically related to the naked woman tree, locally known as Nano (tirucalli pencil tree). Ancestors who lived in harmony with nature evolved the tradition of protecting the forest in honour of the local deity. Nanoda has two groves named Nirankarachi Rai after the holy spirit Nirankar: one lies on the border of Maloli and Nanoda and the other in Nanoda.(The latter is slowly being weathered away by changing values and encroachments. In the past, large areas of forest land were protected through sacred groves such as Nirankarachi Rai. One would find various species of indigenous trees in these groves and no one dared cut a tree. In this way villagers ensured their protection. The densely forested groves were also used by villagers to keep sculptures of village deities. Today, thanks to encroachments, the size of the groves has decreased, while the sculptures lie exposed to the vagaries of nature. Nanodas Nirankarachi Rai, formerly spread across a large area, but is now confined to a small patch where the species  hedu (satinwood), khait (Mimosa catechu), and chafara (Red Frangipani) trees are found. Majestic trees such as maad (coconut) have already been felled.(Inside the sacred grove are 15 stone sculptures-of Gajlaxmi, Mahishasurmardini, Ravalnath, Brahmani, a horse rider and warriors-which are a part of Goas archaeological heritage, are weathering away. Animals like sheryo (pangolin), shekaro (Malabar giant squirrel) are found in sacred groves.()ThreatsMultiple threats to the unique ecology and biodiversity of the Mhedai Wildlife Sanctuary include: illegal heavy vehicular traffic()()  mismanagement of private lands, illegal mining() and tree felling, monoculture plantations, industrial activities, poaching and dams and river diversions(), notably the Malaprabha Reservoir Project and Kalasa-Banduri Nala project.()Mhadei tiger reserveOn June 20, 2011, Ramesh, Minister of State, of Environment and Forests, advised Digambar Kamat, Minister of Goa, to propose the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary as a tiger reserve because of the presence of resident tigers. The MOEF urged Goa to seriously consider the proposal because Mhadei is a contiguous tiger landscape to Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka to its southeast and to Anshi Dandeli Tiger Reserve which has around 35 tigers to its southeast inKarnataka. Ramesh noted that the protected areas of Goa and their contiguous forests in Karnataka and Maharashtra are possibly some of the best tiger habitats in the Western Ghats and are in need of protection. He suggested expanding the tiger reserve beyond the existing Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary.()() On August 9, 2011, there was public announcement that in-principle approval was accorded by the Tiger Conservation Authority for creation of a new Tiger Reserve at Mhadei Sanctuary. Under section 38V of the Protection Act of 1972 the Goa state government was then authorised to notify Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary as a tiger reserve.()  On Aug 8, 2011, Goa Forests Minister Filipe Neri Rodrigues questioned the existence of tigers in the state. It is not my job to know whether there are any tigers here. Rodrigues also said, the state government would not reply to a directive from former union environment and forests minister minister Jairam Ramesh asking the Goa government to submit a proposal for setting up a tiger reserve, unless specifically asked for. Why should we reply?  It is alleged that the Goa governments sluggishness to acknowledge the presence of tigers in Goa is linked to the states Rs. 6,500 crore (US$ ~13,000,000.) mining industry, which rings the Western ghats and most of the tiger terrain near the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary.()There is considerable local community support for creation of the tiger reserve which would ensure long term protection of biodiversity-rich areas.( In September, 2011, the Save Goa Campaign - UK initiated a petition addressed to The Goa Chief Conservator of Forests, Dr. Shashi Kumar, IFS, in support of Goas first tiger reserve.()External sources*Map showing National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries in Goa*Map*Chorla Ghats Forest photograph*Ladkyacho falls photograph*Vazra Sakla waterfalls photograph*Vazra Sakla waterfalls photographReferences"

The station building dates from the time of the First World War. History The origins of this station date back to 1863, when the Railway Company opened a branch line from Essen-berruhr via Ost station (originally Steele station) to Dahlhausen on 21 September 1863.((  ) This line is now considered to be part of the railway between berruhr and Essen-Steele Ost junction and the railway between Essen-Steele Ost and Dahlhausen.  It was primarily used for freight, but on weekdays carriages were also attached. When the line was extended to Hattingen in 1866, a small station building was built in Dahlhausen. On 10 October 1870, the Bochum-DahlhausenBochum Langendreer line (also known as the Hasenwinkel coal line) was opened as a standard gauge railway. The communities of Dahlhausen and Linden were involved in the construction of a new station building that was completed in 1875. By this time the Valley Railway was already open to Hagen. Therefore, the building soon proved to be too small.((Consequently, in 1913 the state railways division at (Kniglich-Preuische Eisenbahndirektion Essen) began building a larger station that it had been planning since 1910 on the double-track DahlhausenSteele line behind a levy bank to prevent flooding by the Ruhr. During the First World War the station was built using prisoners of war and inaugurated on 28 February 1917.((Post-war period With the end of the mining industry in the Ruhr valley, the Ruhr Valley Railway lost its significance. A depot that was 800 m west of Bochum-Dahlhausen closed in 1969.Since 1977, the former locomotive depot has housed the Dahlhausen Railway Museum, the last fully preserved steam locomotive depot in Germany.The station building was closed in 1979, because only S-Bahn trains have operated on the line to Hattingen since 1974. Finally in 1994 the building was heritage-listed. An investor has been allowed to restore the facade and roof in the Nouveau style. The main hall has been restored to the style of the 1920s. In the late 1990s, the building housed a hotel, which operated under the name of Dampflok (steam engine). It was damaged by a fire and since then the historic station building was unused until 2009.(Since 1 September 2009, the former station building has been operated as One World Station, a forum for cultural activities, by a nonprofit organisation, ProKulturgut.Net.(  )In addition to the passenger station Dahlhausen had a marshalling yard, which is now completely dismantled. On one part of the former railway tracks, a housing estate (Ruhrauenpark), has been created, with the first houses going on sale in 2005.Future It is planned to modernise and rebuilt Bochum-Dahlhausen station to make it accessible for the disabled from 2014 at a cost of  4.3 million. The renovation will also improve links between buses and trains.ServicesDahlhausen station today consists of three tracks on two platforms. Tracks 1 and 2 are primarily used for normal S-Bahn traffic, while track 3 is used for museum services operated by the Dahlhausen Railway Museum.( In the immediate vicinity of the station building, a single-track tram line of the Stadtbahn terminates in the pedestrian zone near the station. Line 318 is the only direct tram connection from Dahlhausen to Hauptbahnhof.( It is also served by four bus lines (345, 352, 359 and 390).

A black-wake-up is when you have been to sleep in your bed, and you have just woken up, but for some strange reason your screen goes completely black, and you can hear the ooh, oohing sound which your player makes when he/she has either fallen off a cliff, been attacked by a monster, or a wolf, or have stayed underwater too long, touched lava, or have hurt themeselves in any way. When this first happened to me, my house was located right beside a wide, but not deep hole filled to the brim with obsidian and lava, (which I wanted to mine, but couldnt, as I didnt have a diamond picaxe, as I didnt have diamond. And if I left the hole and lived somewhere else until I found diamond, then I wouldnt be able to find my way back, because I didnt have a map. Anyway, naturally, my first thought was that during the night some of the lava had burnt down my house, and was now burning me. But I was sure that if this was the case, then the screen would not be thoroughly black, and I would see the bright orangy yellow colour of the lava. Besides, when I built a house elsewhere, the same thing happened. Both times I had to respwn, which is so annoying. Those who have respawned before will know what I mean. Then, once again it happened for the third time. This time I was so desperate to save myself. I tried everything. I even poured water on myself. But then I had an idea. I got out my spade, and made a hole in the roof. It stopped. I was alive! I realised that since my house was so small, for some unkown reason, my has had filled up. The only space was the one in which I was standing. Two blocks! I found this out by pressing F5 on my keyboard, which as you may or may not know, makes you able to see yourself. I saw myself curled up in a small space! But as soon as I made a hole in the roof, my house was normal again. Phew!So my  advice is  this - before you go to bed at night, make sure you have a tool in your inventory, that can quickly cut a hole in your roof. And dont make your house too small or your roof too low. Happy mining!"
